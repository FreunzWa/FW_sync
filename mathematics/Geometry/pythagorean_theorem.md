- proof by rearrangment
    + organise 4 of the triangle to the corners of square, area inside is the hypotenuse squared. then rearrange them into rectangles to create two squares, one of side length a and b to show that the missing area is equal to a2+b2, teh same as c2
- similar triangles
- tesellation for a visual proof

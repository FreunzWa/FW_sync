##### Statistics - Introduction
branch of mathematics dealing with data collection, organisation, analyusis, interpretation and presentation.
descriptive and inferential statistics
- can be  misleading, important to understand which question is being answered based on the datatha tis being analysed. 
- descriptive: measures of the nature of the statistics like mean. summarise a given data set, which can be a sample of a population. usu broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability. 
- inferential statistics:  allow makng conclusions beyond the data tha thas.  been collected. (like drawing a correlation about hte general population based on a smaller population)



# Basic stats terms
- proxy
- quantitative data
    + numebrst that have both order and consistent spacing
    + binning is used to display quantitative data in a freqeuency table. unequally spaced bins can be very misleading (eg rebinning by politician to split up an age group that doenst want to vote for him)
    + histograms like bar charts tells how frequently data within a range occur, but also tells how data distributed, @each histogram cell is split up equally. however can also be used to obfuscate data
- categorical data
    + no objective order or consistent spacing
        * usu use a frequency table, a relative freqeuency table (to compare the overall frequency of a category)
        * visualisation
            - bar chart is a useful visualisation measure, stacked bar charts or neighbour charts.  
            - pictogram/ pie chart


# Data visualisations
- dotplot takes a historram and replaces the height with dots, however still lose values. can use a stem and leaf plot, givese more information
- boxplots: also called box and whissker blot. graphical representaiton of data spreae dna measures of central tendency. 
    + shows 1.5x IQR to get maximum/ minimum, IQR, median.  
- cumulative data chart:
    + like a histogram but shows how much data is in the bin and all previous bins. 

Fisher


# Descriptive statistics
- measures of central tendency:
    + good summary of the data as a whole, 
    + the main descriptors, teh median, mean and the mode tell us a lot about a given data set
    + a skewed distribution is when teh median and mean are different, extreme values on one side. 
        * mode will be the peak, median in hte middle and the mean getting pulled away by the extreme points
    + measures
        * mean (average), however this can distort the representation foi teh data. notoriously misleading, important to also consider the way the data is spread, as it is often skewed by outliers, and doesnt reflect a highly vartiable population
        * mode: data that appears the most in a given data set. bimodal data sets/ multimodal data sets when there are 2+ values that are similarly common, usualyl results from the measurement fo 2+ undelrying groups being measured together.
        * normal: roughly symmetrical, equal distribution  on either side of the mean, most of teh results around the mean
        * median - not influenced unduly by far outliers. take mean of the middle 2 numbers if ther eis not just one number in teh middle. 
- measures of spread
    + q1/median/q3. calculate by finding the median of the overall data, then find the median of those two halves. this produces IQR (the middle 50% of the data, the difference between Q3 and Q1)
    + iqr - doesnt consider extremes, 
    + variance: 
        * distance from teh mean line squared, then the total area of all of the sqaures is taken, this is the variance of the data. 
    + standard deviation
        * is the square root of the variance, thus the units are more intuitive
        * the average amount that we expect a point to differ from teh mean



# examples
- mean income rising, but median falling -- because families at the top end are earning more whilst most families are falling based on the decrease in teh mean. need to look at teh mode and dthe median, will see a decreas ein both whilst hte mean is artificially elevated by a small smaple of the population


# distributions
- distribvution 
    + discrete: few set values (looks like histograms, tells spread and shape of data)
    + continuous: can take any value
- uniform distributions
    + aka rectangular distribution, is a distribtion that has constant probability. the median is equal to the mean but every value is equally frequent. 

bivariate data in a scatter plot, allows identification of many relationships 

regression line: a line that is as close as posssible to all poitns in teh data set. 
regression coefficient: 

correlation: measures the way that two variables more together. 

r is the measure of correlaiton, between 1 and -1 as they are scaled by the standard deviation. r is teh correlation coefficient .


squared coefficient: explaining variation 

correlation doesnt imply causation.  
possibilites when data is correlated:
A causes B
B causes A
variable C unmeasured causes both A and B
there is no relationship, just coincidence. 'spurious correlations'

# data simulation
- to find correlation, split population into groups randomly to claim that there are no systematic differneces between teh groups, and then run an intervention into one group and a false intervention int eh other. 
- however, it is pssible that there are still differences, so can use blockling, block design to split the group into subgroups that are based on factors that are not of primary interest to teh researcher. 
- single blind: so each participant experiences that act of being treated.
- double blind: subconsciously project beliefs onto participants. 

# sampling methods
- non experiemntal method: 
    + survey. however issues with represeentation. non response bias - some group sof people are less likely to respond to surveys. , volunatry response bias -- people who are more likely to respond are those with very strong opinions. stratified random sampling ensures better representations.. 
    + snowbal sampling: researchers gete people to forward surveys on


Bayes theorem is very similar to that of conditional probability:
- the numerators are the only part that differs however they are really equivalent. inspired strong movmenet in statistical community. 
- updating belief sbased on new information. 
- frequentist approach is less dependent on prior knowledge
- law of large numbers: ass thge sample of data gets bigger the mean of the set gets closer to teh population means. s

Binomial distribution
- combinatorial calculation
bernoulli distribution
geometric probability distribution, cumulative geometric distribution



P value:
- the probability of getting sample data that is as extreme or more extreme than ours ASSUMING the null hypotehsis is true.

# US Government 

# History
- this is the 2nd iteration of a US government, the first was the articles of confederation during the revolutionary war. poorly executed

# Separation of powers
- National governemnt has powers separated into 3 bodies
    + legislative branch (the US congress)
        * comprised of an upper and lower house (the senate and house of representatives)
        * it has most of the power
    + executive branch
        * lead by the president, which oversees teh other branches and tries to ensure that the other branches fulfill their functions. 
        * is largely controlled by US congress
    + judicial branch
        * interpret the law, oversees the supreme court
        * largely controlled by US congress

# Balancing of the branches
- the US constitution allows the branches to check the other branches to ensure that their power may be limited if there are concerns for abuse of power, safeguarding against tyrannical government
- powers of CONGRESS
    + CONGRESS limiting EXECUTIVE
        * the legislative branch (specficially the senate) is vested the power of impeachment (if 2/3 of members vote for impeachment)
        * congress can also reject presidents appointment of officials to the government.
        * either branch of congress can investigate executive activities/ officers
        * if the executive branch - president vetos a law then then the congress can invalidate this veto with a 2/3 vote. 
        * they can reject appropriation of funds for executive programs
    + CONGRESS limiting JUDICIAL
        * impeach and remove judges
        * can reject judicial nominees
        * congress can add or remove courts to change the federal court system
        * can pass new laws that change US supreme court decisions
    + CONGRESS can also add ammendments to the constitution 
- powers of EXECUTIVE
    + over CONGRESS
        * president can veto congress laws
        * carries out CONGRESS's laws, and may implement the law differently to what congress wanted
    + over JUDICIAL
        * can appoint new supreme court judges
        * can pardon people convicted by the courts
- powers of JUDICIAL
    + the weakest branch, has fewest checks over the other two branches
    + over CONGRESS
        * can declare laws unconstitutional
        * supreme judge presides over impeachment trials
    + over EXECUTIVE
        * can declare that executive acts are unconstitutional
        * issues warrants in feederal crime cases
        * invalidating laws and executive actions

# Congress
- elections 
    + house of representatives
        * chosen every 2nd year by the people of several states/ electors
        * US broken up into districts (subdivisions of states)
        * incumbency advantage (more likely for current incumbent to keep office during an election)
        * the electoral connection predicts the actions of a given house of rep based on the inclination to get re-elected
    + senate
        * 1/3 is replaced
- committees
    + congress broken up into standing committees to make them more efficient, often the committees between senate and house overlap 
    + each committee has a chair
    + teh congress can also create temporary/ permanent special committees, and can declare them as advisory or law making (the climate committee is only an advisor committee)
    + house standing committee (19 committees)
    + senate (16 standing committees)
- proposing a bill within a committee
    + any member in a committee within congress can propose a bill (proposal power), it then goes to a committee. the chair can control which aspects of thee bill are kept
    + then the bill is voted on within the committee (if negative -- the bill dies within committee)
- the speaker
- congress staff
    + staff around a given legislator - does most of the work around writing legislature/ bill writing
- caucus system
    + semi formal groups of congresspeople organised around specific issues, allows discussion/ lobbying - helps members of congress coordinate their efforts
    + eg the black caucus, republican caucus, tea party caucus, bike caucus
- congressional leadership (and the link to the political parties) 
    + HOUSE
        * majority party leadership within congress
            - leader of the house is the speaker (3rd most powerful person in the country, elections frot this is every 2 years like the rest of congress)
            - majority whip
            - house of majority leader (chosen by the speaker)
        * minority party:
            - minority whip
            - house of minority leader (spokesperson for the minotry party in the house -- so see it on the TV)
    + SENATE
        * majority party:
            - majority leader
        * minority party:
            - minority leader: party's spokesperson
    + in both the senate and the house the leaders control congress functions through committee assignments (thus they can punish or reward committees with good or bad assignments).. esp the speaker


# How a bill becomes law
- congressman or senator has an idea for a new law/ bill
- introduced, then referred to an appropriate committee in either house (but it most go through both houses and be approved by both)
- in the SENATE 
    + then receives markup (legal language), if gets a majority
    + opened to the floor of the senate, which decides how long the debate will go on for and whether it should be open rule (allowed ammendments) or closed (no ammendments)
- in the HOUSE
    + the senate version of the bill is sent to the house rules committee, which then reports it out to the house.
    + if it receives a majority in the house, then either passed to SENATE or if both have already passed, then goes to the PRESIDENT
- usually the second will want to make some ammendments, then goes to a CONFERENCE COMMITTE whith reps from both houses, allowed to make changes (COMPROMISE BILL), then goes back to both houses
- then to the PRESIDENT who can:
    + sign the bill
    + veto the bill
        * congress can override the veto with a 2/3 majority (very rare that this happens)
    + pocket veto
    + not do anything, in which case the bill becomes a law after 10 days
- bill death points (veto gates) - these were added to prevent tyrannical government
    + speaker does not have to refer it onwards
    + the committee doesnt vote on the bill, or no majority
    + either house doesnt schedule a vote on the bill
    + philbuster
    + veto


------------------------------------------------------

# Federalism
- the idea that in the US the governments power is divided between the US govt and the govt of the individual states (state govts).
- dual federalism (up until the 1930s new deal)
    + 1788-1937, govt power was divided between national govt and state govts 
    + the national govt did not have as many roles as the state govts, keeping away from business regulation/ social regulation/ welfare (classical economic policy)
    + with this system some things are taken care of by teh national govt, other things by the state govts. different jurisdictions, state controls more processes
        * national: foreign policy and trade, regulates currency, controls public land
        * state govt: roperty laws, commercial laws, banking laws, family law, insurance, public health, education, criminal laws, elections, licensing 
- cooperative federalism
    + "carrot stick" federalism.. the governmetn is more centralised and has more power
    + introduced after the new deal where the national governemtns presides over state govts to ensure that they strive to achieve globally defined goals
        * through grants/ aids (national govt money distributed to states used for specific things)
            - formula grant: state gets money based on need for a given policy (eg social welfare policy - the more need for this a state has the more money it will get)
            - project grant
            - block grant: state gets a huge chunk of money for something vauge like 'infrastructure' - then the state figures out how to spend the money
- regulated federalism - mandates
    + these are laws that apply to all states, and are usually regulations over business (eg climate laws, civil rights standards).
    + can be unfunded or funded mandates (sometimes a state will get money to change activities to abide with rules)
- new federalism
    + more block grants (then they decide what to do with it)
    + devolution: allows states to change national regulative principles locally
- US federalism now
    + the US has a cooperative federalism with some areas that are highly regulated. many conservative voters want a return to more decentralised power with dual federalism

# Executive branch: Presidential powers & limitations

- the president election
    + 35+ yrs old, born in the US
    + elected by the electoral college, which limits the publics say over the president, a potential limitation to democracy
    + was originally conceived to have limited powers to prevent tyranny by the framing powers
- categories of power (constitutional powers) "formal powers"
    + military
        * after congress has declared war
    + judicial
        * can appoint supreme court judges
        * can pardon those convicted in courts 
    + diplomacy
        * has power to make treaties with foreign powers (needs 2/3 support in senate)
        * ambassador
    + legislative power
        * can propose laws by getting a member of congress to introduce a bill
        * can veto laws passed by congress
    + executive powers
        * ensre that las are carried out
- newer, non constitutional powers "informal powers"
    + can also mobilise troops in non war periods (@emergency) - congress tried to limit this by passing new law that limits president by needing to get congress approval within 60 days of mobilising troops
    + executive agreements (easier to pass as does not require Senate approval)
    + executive order is the most important legislative power, allows president to circumvent the congressional process and act unilaterally. -- can be overturned easily by the successor much more easily than a congressionally passed law. 
    + can order bureaucracy to implement laws in certain ways.
- limitations
    + does not have too much power over congress (aside from veto)
- responsibilites
- strategies of the president
    + administrative strategies (through theh executive office - changing functions of the federal agencies)    
        * executive order - push through major policy that would otherwise be dififcult to push through congress
    + party leadership (lead party in congress to pass legislation more easily, much easier if both houses are lead by the same party)
    + mobilising public opinion - media influences/ press conference


# The rest of the executive branch
- structure of the executive branch
    + president
        * vice president
    + white house staff
        * chief of staff
        * press secreary
    + executive officers (selected by the president) EOP
        * national security counciel

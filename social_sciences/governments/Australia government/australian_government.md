###### Australian government basics
- note that the number of seats is increasing from 150 to 151

# Australian parliament
- based on a federal constitutional monarchy using structures from
    + UK westminster system
    + US congress (federation)
- federal system
    + 6 states and 3 self governing territories (each has own constitution, parliament and laws). these are based on the same principls as parliamentary govt
- Aus constitution
    + written @fedeeration of colonies in 1901, estalbishes framework for the political functions: legislative (create laws), executive (implement laws), judicial (interpret laws and apply them) 
    + these functions are held by different bodies 
- LEGISLATIVE: Parliament of australia (has the legislative function)
    + bicameral to prevent one from becoming too powerful
        * house of reps (lower house) 151 MPs, elected from electorates determined by population (roughly 100,000 each) so that they represent roughyl equal number fo people
            - wrties and votes on bills 
        * senate (upper house) 76 members, 12 from each state and 2 from the mainland territories " house of review "
            - can block bills originating in the house of reps
            - this one does not have proportional representation, 12 from each state - so tasmania gets 12
- EXECUTIVE: PM + governer general
    + GG is to appoint ambassadors, judges and ministers (but the PM tells them who to appoint) - position is largely ceremonial
    + PM
        * direct policy in the cabinet
        * must be the leader of the party which has teh majority support in teh house of reps (76+ seats must be held)
- JUDICIAL
    + high court of australia
        * interprets consitution and laws
        * power of judicial review of laws from the parliament
- hung parliament
    + no coalition/ party has a majority , must form alliance with crossbenchers (either members of small policitcal parties or independents)

- australia is a 2 party system
    + labor is centre left (social democratic)
    + liberal is centre right (middle class and rural Australians, and business)
    + Greens (socialist, environmentalist)
    + ON (conservative, nationalistic)


# The australian senate
- basics    
    + upper house of the bicamral system in teh parliament house. 
    + powers are established in ch1 section 2 of the constitution of australia
    + 76 senators, 12 from each state, and 2 from each of the internal territories -- equal representation thus (more similar to the US system)
    + unlike other upper houses in otherw Westminster parliamentary systems, the Senate ahs signifiant powers - rejecting bills
    + the governing party/ coaliation has not held a majority in the Senate since 2005-2008, and before that 1981 so usually need to get independent/ parties to get legislation passed.
    + established 1900
    + the PM and treasurer are members of the house of reps, but the other cabinet members may come from either house. 
    + because of the representation system there are many independents/ smaller parties in the crossbencher section
- senate electoral system
    + 1948: single transferable vote proportional representation
    + 1984: group ticket voting, allowing either above line to select party and then they would distribute preferences on their behalf or below the line, allowing numbering of every candidate. also increased the number of senators from each state to 12
    + 2016: parties were using preference delas to distort election results in the lower house. allowed voters to number parties above the line. 
- senators
    + term: fixed 6 year terms. in each election, approx 40 of the 76 are open for election, the other seats are maintained. 
    + however the senate can be dissolved early @a double dissolution
    + however the seats form the two territories are not fixed 6 yeras, always reopened with election for the house of reps
    + there is no constitutional requirement to have house of reps and senate elections on the same day, but usually synchronicesd. 
    + equal representation is a big issue ("unrepresentative swill"), tasmania elects 12 with a population of 500,000, same as NSW from a population of 7 million. however this system means that the composition of the senate differs from the house of reps, allowing it to act as a house of review
- double dissolution
    + all 76 senators face re-election
    + last time was 1970
    + is a procedure permitted in the constitution to break deadlocks @totally non functional upper and lower house. when this occurs the upper house is also dissolved, and the GG is called for relection.
        * after the egeneral election, the legislation will brought back to the house of reps and senate through the norm al process
        * if still not passed there is a "joint sitting", to vote on the legislation -- so teh house of reps is more powerful
        * joint sittin ghas only happened once (in 1974) 


# Victorian state government
- also a bicameral system, with an upper house (the victorian legislative council)

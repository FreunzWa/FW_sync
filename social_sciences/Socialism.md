###### Socialism

Labor theory of value:
- that the value of something is equivalent to the amount of labor put into it. i do not agree with this, as there is such thing as wasted/ ineffective labor, producing goods produced in a wasteful way, thus the valu is less than the labor put into it. labor can be harnessed in different degrees of efficiency, and thus goods produced will be of different vlaue. 
- Ben shapiro says that demanding value for useless labor is stupid though this is one of the principles of the socialist process. To recognise this useless labor with reward incentivises the whole process and limits production. For instance lesbian dance major/ liberal arts major students demanding to get paid 6 figures after graduating. 
- Labor should be exchanged voluntarily for other labor in a free market fashion.

Universal Basic income
- recent experiment in Finland where 2000 unemployed received a basic income without the usual unemployment benefits. experiment lasted 2 years. the experiment was small. however there is still a disincentive to work. there was no statistically significant impact on uneumployment, however there is increased quality of life. 

Workers controlling business - Bill Gates is a worker at his business, investors are all workers at the business exchanging labor 
- private ownership: this is basically capitalism

Worker cooperative
- firm that is owned and self managed by workers, all workers in the business hold a share of that company.
- they are closer to capitalism than socialism because in socialism everything is controlled by the government. this will not solve any income asymmetries and still operates under free market theory. 

# Examples of socialism
- Truly socialist countries where there is total government control over industry have been shown to be wildly unproductive, counterproductive. There is an inhibition to normal free market sentiment.
    + examples include cuba and venezuela, whose economies are now totally busted. venezuela ridiculous hyperinflation, people eating dogs, people running away.
- Norway: Democratic socialist country, the government has stock in companies but there is free market functionality over the top. It is not totally government regulated. 
- Denmark: Still largely privately owned


# Criticism
- who will pay for socialism (free education, free healthcare)
    + making everyting free is expensive, who will pay for it all
        * this is a difficult question to answer for socilaists, of course the argument should be increased taxation on the wealthy with the means to pay these taxes. however this is not a good solution! when threatened with the prospect of increased taxation there will be a shift in resources overseas when the wealthy want to keep their money. this would harm the economy.
- Ronald Reagan
    + Why socialism doesnt work: story about boy in teh soviet union going out to buy a car, which takes 10 years, so many stamps needed to be done, and then asks morning or afternoon -- well the plumbers coming in the morning. 
- Margaret Thatcher
    + Socialism works alright until you run out of other people's money
- tax success and subsidize bad decisions = socialism


# Proponents of socialism
- arguments
    + equality of outcome vs. equality of opportunity. 
- many millennials
    + many millennials no longer want to compete and thus cannot succeed under capitalism. the capitalist system, being a free market economy necessarily requires that you compete as there are no social safety nets.
- notable people
    + bernie sanders (often considered the bastion of the socialist movement)
    + barack obama

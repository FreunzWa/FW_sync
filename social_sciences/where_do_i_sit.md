###### Thinking about my Political position

There must be a distinction between the political position that I have at heart and the political position that I portray in public. I have this aim as I think that based on my identity many of my political opinions would be highly controversial if brought to the public forum. 

Political positions are contigent on the goals one has for society, as it is through policy and societal reform that these goals can be realised. My primary goal for society is rapid technological development and production. I want the human race to grow as quickly as possible thus I believe in industrial development, distribution and allocation of resources.

My acutal political position is probably described as Far-Left, in that I argue for a powerful governement with strong and far reaching societal regulation

# Transgender debate
- realise that it is an issue which can cause significant psychological stress, offer medical solutions to the problem in the form of treatment. 
- in medical cricles, always state there assigned sex at birth.
- transgender woman/ man: these are men/ women who 'believe / want to be' the opposite sex, do not give them the affirmation that they are the sex that they proclaim to be. 
- not going to modify basic biology because it threatens your subjective sense of what you are
- give the age argument. how old are you? So why arent you 60? Can you identify yourself as being 60
    + retort: well gender and age are 2 completely different issues

# Abortion
- REVISED:
    + abortion is clearly morally wrong, you cannot argue that point. if your morals dictate that you are not to end the life of any human then that should also apply to abortion as it is indeed a living unique human being
    + abortion should be legal however, in my opinion it should be reserved for fringe cases in which there was an element of sexual abuse - this is basically the only reason it should be practised, or if the mother's and by extension teh child's life is in danger. 
    + i believe that the solution to the problem is in addressing the warped 21st century culture around sexual relations. sex after marriage. this is not realistic for todays society and so as unfortunate as it is this is a debate that will likely continue.  

- OLD THINKINGS
    + this is a very difficult issue. there is no argument that in aborting a pregnancy you are taking a human life, regardless of what stage of pregnancy the abortion is undertaken. The closer it is to term the more grotesque the act is, but the result is unchanged in that you are taking a life in the process. it is biological fact that a life is being taken, unimpeded a life will result. would you kill someone in a coma that you know is going to wake up in 9 months? No, of course not. 
    + based on this recognition then, one would assume that I am anti-abortion and pro-life. However my position is complex, and actually leans towards pro-abortion. The above point is something that basically no rational person arguing for abortion-choice will recognise because then they invite the label of murderer. they probably try to shroud their understanding of this issue and convince themselves that at that stage the baby is just a part of them (despite having a distinct geneitc makeup, lungs, a beating heart, different blood type - could well be a different gender). so they are deluded, and this is the liberal view.  
    + however, i am still pro-abortion. is it a purely libertarian stance? Yes it is, I believe people should have control over their reproductive capacity, despite the fact that it is effectively killing babies. I do not recognise human life as sacred -- i am not religious so arguments pertaining to the sanctity of human life are immaterial to me. I care only for the collective expansion of the human race, and unplanned pregnancies can impose a restrictiono individuals to realise their career aspirations, which i consider to be more important. 
    + Ultimately i call for sterilisation of all, and reproduction to occur ex-vivo, the entire process seen over by an incubator. 
    + of course, i can never say this in public, so what is the solution. do i pretend to be a deluded liberal and blind side the truth of the nature of the act or do i play the conservative card. I think i need to play conservative, which means i need to promulgate a view which is not necessarily my own. I must appear morally intact, and of course it is considered immoral to kill children, thus we must degenerate to the anti-abortion view. however we always recognise that the issue is complex, just cant get over the hurdle of ending a life in its most vulnerable stage. 

# Opinions on Socialism
- moving towards equality of outcome
- ask someone if they would support a socialist GPA system at their university. 
    + perfect example because the system rewards hard work and people who do not work do not succeed.
- my position is that i like to encourage free market activity as much as possible, but there are inherent inefficiencies in capitalist systems that emerge due to runaway human greed. this has been shown in the past and was in part the cause for past economic crises affecting the free market system. this does not reflect poorly on the underlying rational assumption based free market neoclassical eeconomic theory. it does reflect why these assumptions break-down, as humans are not always rational and people do stupid things, because many people are stupid and do not behave optimally in a capitalist system. these psychological inconsistencies cause issues like price and wage stickiness, which prevent the free market system from operating smoothly even in teh absence of any sort of governmental socioeconmic regulation. free market theorists believe that even at a minimum government intervention is wrong and prevents free markets from reaching a stable equilibrium. i cannot refute this with equations, because it is fairly irrefutable. it is based on the assumptions, and it comes down to human psychology with the equations cannot model. 
    + mild graduated tax system. i believe a progressive tax system which is not burdensome for the wealthy, and one that does not encourage shifting wealth overseas en-masse. i believe 50% is too much, way too much as some states have. as a percentage of wealth it should not increase that much. in the lowest brackets people should not pay much at all. i would prefer there to be $cut-offs as well.
    + social welfare system: some variation of universal basic income that incentivises work.  
- the main proponents of socialism are people who would benefit from increased welfare, such as students. so of course in my position i have to support social welfare as a student, as it has permitted me to go to university and study to the degree that i have. it comes in the form of student loans which is better than the govt just supporting free education because it should encourage students to make judicious decisions about what they study, how much time they spend at universty, and make rational degree choices based on perceived openings in the job market. at the moment however, the govt supports CSP places, which pay outright for 80% of my degree fees, otherwise i would rack up loans close to $500,000. with this, my loan will be close to 80-100,000 which is entirely interest free so the governmetn loses money on that as well. furthering the inefficiency. there probably should be a low interst to at least keep with the 2% inflation rate. 
- if there is going to be global free education, then the govt needs to ensure that people doing degree will be able to help GDP by entering the workforce to effecively earn this money back indirectly. thus no stupid obscure arts degrees - these must be paid for byt he students. thus the government should give support based on teh degree in question.
    + thus a blind catch all free education system must be a huge economic blunder.
- My ideal social welfare

# Opinions on capitalism
- some people may say that it is equality of opportunity - a meritocracy. however in some respects this is not true as some people have significant advantage over others based on nothing but the size of their parents bank accounts. these people can afford a better education, get into better jobs, and as a result there is continuity of wealth.
- for some people there would be basically nothing they can do. they would have to work stupid hours to be able to get into college, whilst other more privileged individuals would be able to use this time studying/ getting ahead/ joining clubs and societies. 
- so, is capitalism fair? Of course not, in its purest sense how could it be fair. do we need society to be fair though, can we really make everyone happy? I do believe that there should be some provision made to prevent poverty, and enable people even from poorer backgrounds to enter high education positions if they make good decisions. 

# Opinions on equal pay laws
- gender pay gap exists in that there is a measurable difference between male and female salaries, and that this is more present in some industries than others.
    + the reasons for this are multiple, but i do not agree with the idea that sexism and misogyny play a central role - these are likely to be secondary factors.
- there is currently an experiment undergoing in Iceland to enforce equal pay laws. 


- arguments against equal hiring
    + cannot hire for instance, take the example of engineers 50% women and 50% men because the quality of the work will be decreased because the male engineers will be more qualified because the pool of male applicants is more. that just speaks to the fact that there are gender based differences in interest for certain careers
        * argument counter - that this difference 
- that there are other factors which determien the gender pay gap - things like agreeability
    + agreeability is a more common trait amongst females, and less assertive, meaning less likely to ask for pay increases. 
- that this is an example of equity, which will affect the free market effects that govern hiring nad competition between workers.

1. Hit first. 2. Frame your opponent. 3. Frame the debate. 4. Spot inconsistencies in their arguments. 5. Force them to answer questions. 6. Don't get distracted. 7. If you don't know something, admit it. 8. Don't get sucked in by the paradime. 9. Make sure that you let the other side have a meaningless victory or two, so they feel like they are accepted. 10. Use good body language at all times.

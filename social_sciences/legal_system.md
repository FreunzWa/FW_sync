###### Legal system
- appellate jurisdiciton (review of a lower court decision)
- original jurisdiction (when the case is brought fresh to a court without having been to another court)



# structure of the US court system
- heirarchical layout of the US court system
    + US supreme court (final court of appeal)
        * 
    + federal courts
        * US courts of appeal (circuit courts)
        * US district courts
    + state courts
        * highest state court
        * state appeals courts
        * state trial courts
    + most cases are settled outside court by lawyers

- cases when an appeal must go straight to district court (it having original jurisdiction)
    + cases where the law in question is federal law
    + cases involved treaties/ us constitution
    + cases involving the us govt as a party in teh litigation
    + when the case involves multiple states and involves >70k $
- cases in which the supreme court has original jurisdiction (basically cases that it would not make much sense for it to occur in one state)
    + between US and a state
    + between 2 or more state
    + cases involving foreign ministers/ ambassadors
    + on crimes in national waters 

# US Supreme court (SCOTUS)
- the rule of 4, where the judges decide whether or not the case is worth hearing in the SCOTUS, usu if federal law/ rights are involved


# courts
- functions
    + settle disputes between citizens
    + interpret the laws 
    + enforce conduction of fair business
- most cases get settled by lawyers out of courts. 
- if you lose at court, can appeal the decision to a higher court with appellate jurisdiction (must be able to show that something was unfair during the trial process in teh lower court)

# federal court system
- heirarchical, with supereme courts at the top and lower courts at the bottom. a case in a lower court can be appealed to a higher court in which case the higher court may affirm or overturn the lower courts' decision
- federal judges are appointed for life and the salaries cannot be reduced (preserve their independence from politics)
- common law: a court decision sets a precedent for other courts that applies that decision. 
- trial courts

# law
- criminal law and civil law (combine to  public law)
    + criminal law are statutes written by legistlatures, thus an actual law to break - these set of laws are called the penal code. the government is the prosecutor in these cases, done at a state level, thus the laws
    + civil laws broken with disputes between individuals, there is usually no jail term for a civil case, usually financial penance. 
    + a civil or criminal case can become public law when a federal law, powers of govt or rights of citizens by the constitution is involved in the case (eg violation of mongol citizen rights)

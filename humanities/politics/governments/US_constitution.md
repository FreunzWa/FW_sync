###### US constitution 
- formation of US governments to federate states intially set out in teh Virginia plan, which specified that there would be proportional representation to the population of the state.
- however from small new jersey made a new jersey plan, which specified that each state would send the same number of delegates to limit the larger states' power
- the connecticut compromise sepcified a bicameral legislature
    + the house of reps has representation proportional to population -- initially difficult as some states wanted to count slaves as part of the population (3/5 compromise -- 3/5 of non free persons, embedded slavery into the constitution)
    + senate has equal number from each state
- those that supported the constitution were the federalists, others were anti-federalists (thought that a centralised governemnt is too powerful, sacrificing individual liberties)

###### Bank fundamentals
- started as a place that would protect money
- became major source of credit creation by allowing investors to take out loans to finance operations. 
    + traditional loaning has decline in popularity @other options to finance operations
- banks exist because people int eh economy are different, they are heterogenous and have different skills 

# Types of banks
- Commerical banks (retail bank)
    + cater directly for general public and give loans from small-mid sized firms
- Wholesale banks
    + transact with other banks and financial institutions
- investment banks (Merchant banks)
    + concentrate on raising money for companies from pirvate investors or in the financial markets by finding buyers for their equirty and corporate bonds.
- Universal banks
    + perform most of the above functions

# The bank balance sheet
- banks hold equity to absorb possible losses on teh assets they own. however @too much equity == limtis profitability. 
    + this will determine the banks fragility. banks can be fragile @aggressive investing
- banks take on a lot of debt from people that deposit money into the bank (deposits are a large part of the debt a bank has. it uses this debt to invest and leverage)


# In the 2008 financial crisis
- many of the worlds banks were highly leveraged (up to 50x their holdings in capital - alpha), as they were confident in their positions and could keep reserves low because they could be confident in govt bonds. 
- also assumed that the govt would bail out the banks if they went bankrupt

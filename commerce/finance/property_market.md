# Rent market
- rent rates increase with rising house prices because realtively affluent would-be home buyers move in to rental properties because the house prices are too high. this forces rental prices up. this occurs until an equilibirium poijnt is reached. 
- with higher interest rates rent rates will likely decrease, as people are less likely to be able to take on loans to finance house buying/ renting. lower interest rates cause increased house prices and rent prices.

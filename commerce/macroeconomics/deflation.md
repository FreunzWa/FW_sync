###### Deflation
- negative inflation rate, w falls in price level of GS == rise in value of currency. 
- always damaging to the economy, can result in a deflationary spiral, exacerbate economic conditions in a recession and increases the real value of debt. 
    + deflatrionary spiral when there is intiial decrease in AD == falls in prices and decreased consumption == -=wages == further decreased AD == exacerbates and self perpetuates.
    + an example in history is the Great Depression.  

# In history
- deflation was the incitng cause behind the Long Depression and the Great Depression


# Causes
- supply is high (excess production) == demand falls relatively == prices drop. when prices are falling under New-Keynesian economics, consumers hoard money because its value is increasing == liquidity trap (everyone has money rather than purchase GS) less spending in the economy/ decreased AD == further drops in prices == deflationary spiral. 
- under New-Keynesian the way to correct  this is to have an expansionary policy and do defecit spending, expand the money supply to cause inflation. 
- decrease in money supply relative to population growth/ economic growth (caused by a contraction @careless investment).
- enduring decrease in teh rreal cost of goods based on tech advancements == competititve price cts == increased AD. 



- distinct from disinflation (a decline but still positive inflation)


# Consequences of deflation
- causes transfer of wealth from borrowers and holders of illiquid assets to benefit savers and holders of liquid assets and currency. thus opposite to the useful scenario of inflation where savers are taxed and use the proceeds to subsidise borrowers/ investments. (however the higher this effect is the more chance of bubble)
- the value of real debt increases, as the buying power of money has increased and now receiving less wages, the repayments become a larger portion of wealth. this can cause ruin for some with significant debts, and discrouage people to take on debt for investments. 

# Measures against deflation
- debt relief.

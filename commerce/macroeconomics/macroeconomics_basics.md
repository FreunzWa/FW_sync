###### Macroeconomics basics
- study of how entire economy functions on a regional/ national/ global scale with special interest @aggregated indicators such as GDP/ unemployment/ national income/ price indices -- and what these can tell us how the ecoomoy is performing
- in macroeconomics, aim to construct a model for the entire economy (not just the individual markets) and thus consider how external shocks and policies will affect the economy. 
- also look @different sectors
- business cycle (short-run fluctuations in the national income)
- determinatns of long-run economic performance (eg overall increases in national income)

### 3 central topics to macroeconomics
- Output and income
    + National output (aggregate output, measured in GDP per person
    + output correlates with national income.
    + output in general does increase with time due to advances in technology and human education/ health etc.
    + however there may be short-run decreases in output @business cycles (with recessions)
    + macroeconomic policies are designed to decrease severity/ incidence of these recssions by maintaing economic output

- Unemployment
    + measured @unemployment rate (percentage workers without jobs in teh labor force - only including those actively looking for work)
    + types of unemployment:
        * classical unemployment: @wages too high == employrs higher less workers. however other theories suggest that @++wages == demand is higher == actually less employment.
        * frictional unemployment: occurs due to latency period in finding a new job. ('aka' search unemployment). important to reduce as much as possible as this can be substantial to economy @long periods. 
        * structural unemployment: @shifts in infrastructure/ emphasis on different sectors == less jobs open for people with certain skills. (similar to frictional @both involve matching workers with job vacacnies.)

- Inflation & Deflation
    + measured with price indices
    + @rapid money supply expansion == excess economy growth == inflation
    + monetary policy (central bank policy) is aimed @temprering the inflation rate, (usually under 2%)
    + usually price changes are reflected in the money supply, but short-run factors such as recession (affecting aggregate demand) can also influence prices.

# AD-AS model
- aggregate demand/ aggregate supply model.

# IS-LM model

### Macroeconomic policy
- implemented through fiscal/ monetary policy.

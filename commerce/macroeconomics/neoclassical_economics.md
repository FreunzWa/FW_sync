###### Neoclassical economics (orthodox economics)

- Neoclassical economics is an approach to economics that relates supply and demand to an individual's rationality (based on maximising own satisfaction) and his ability to maximize utility or profit - it is this that drives the markets.
- uses a lot of mathematical equations to study the economy. 
- believes that a GS often has value that exceeds its input costs (CE believe that the vlaue is equal to its inputs). this is the marginal utility theory of value. 
- most widely supported economic theory today, with many of the worlds economies build on Neoclassical economics but with extenbtions and refinements.

# Detractions:
- that not all humans make rational decisions (there are other factors which may cause people to make irrational or 'wrong' decisions which may prevent market equilibrium and efficient resource distribution)
- possible contributor to the GFC, as economists may believe that there is no upper bound to the profits to be made from a GS.

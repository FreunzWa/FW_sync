###### Keynesian economics ('demand' side economics)
- believes that economic activity is driven by short term demand for GS
- economic theory of total spending in the economy and its effect on output and inflation. 
- in general, it advocates government intervention and regulation to  influence aggregate demand to control the market to prevent recession/ depression. opposes laissez faire economies.
- focuses on changes in the economy in the short term.

# The General theory of employment, interest, money
- published work, stressed that certain characterisitcs of market economics could exacerbate economic weakness and cause AD to plunge further. 
- key points
    + refutes the idea that lower wages restores full employment, he argues that employers will not hire to make goods which cannot be sold. firms will only produce goods that they can expect to sell. 
    + further, suggests @poor business conditions and declining income will prevent business from making capital investments. 
    + reject that the economy necessarily returns to a natural state of equilibirum.
    + developed the boom and bust cyclical idea about the economy. 
        * from this he advocates for a countercyclical fiscal policy.
    + Keynesian multiplier effect. suggests that initial fiscal stimulus will promote AD, spending and result in an overall amplification in GDP relative to stimulus amount. 

# Employment theory
- keynes believed that nominal wages display downward rigidity @workers do not like to accept wage cuts. this can cause UE @have to decrease work force to pay wages


# Recommended nature of government intervention
- during economic growth:
    + advocates increased taxation/ cut spending
- during economic recession:
    + defecit spending to stimulate the economy.

# History
- developed by Keynes during the great depression to understand the factors that lead to the GD, and how to mitigate it/ prevent recurrence.

# Opposition to classical economics
- previous to KE, CE held that the cyclical swings in UE and output would be modest and self correcting due to a constant state of equilibrium
- according to CE, in the event of declining aggregate demand == -=production/jobs == prices fall and wages fall. in CE mind, with lower prices/ wages lower == corporations more likely to make capital investments and employ more people, which would stimulate employment and restore economic growth.
- however the GD greatly tested this hypothesis.

### IS-LM model (Hicks Hansen model)

# Basics of IS-LM
- (investment-savings, liquidity-money)
- Keynesian macroeconmoic model that shows how the market for economic goods (IS) interacts with the loanable funds market (LM liquidity preference - money supply) - the money market.
- is a formalised graphical representation of Keyne's theory, not actually introduced directly by Keynes himself. 
- the graph shows relationship between real output (GDP) and nominal interest rates. 
- called the 'Keynesian' cross as the two markets, output and money, which push both markets (goods and asset markets) simultaneously towards equilibrium
- dominant analysis tool in the 40s-70s, now not used, but seen mainly in textbooks. 

# Keynesian cross diagram (the expenditure-output). 
- formulation of the central ideas of Keyne's general theory
- plots economic output/ income (Y) - x axis - and aggregate expenditure - y axis. 
- there is an upward sloping line that shows a positive correlation between demand for GS and income (of households and firms)
- the meeting of the AD/ AI curve with the 45 degree line is the point of equilibrium where there is no unintended accumulation of firms' inventories. 
    + at this point there is market clearing, as the AD has become equal to output
    + this is the point where there is no incentive of firms to move away from that point. 
- How it falls back to equilibrium
    + when expenditure is larger than output, then firms will higher more workers/ make investment to produce more GS == people paid more == 

# IS-LM model. 
- relationship between investment-savings, liquidity-money. interaction between the output market and the money market.

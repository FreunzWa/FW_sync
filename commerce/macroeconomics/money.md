# History
- original non monetary societies relied on barter, but also gift economies and debt. barter usubetween strangers/ enemies. 
- eventually many cultures developed commodity money (when there were no overarching govt that could declare a bit of paper legal tender, nor the legal frameworks to prevent counterfeiting). 
    + examples include shell money (whose value derived from body ornamentation) most commonly used was the money cowry (monetaria moneta). used in pacific/ se asian countries. 
    + first coinage abt 650-600 BC
    + representative money evolved originally from a receipt for commodity money deposited in a bank/ gold/ silver merchants. these receipts eventually became accepted for payment/ money. initially in China during the 7th centry. used alongside commodity money. in 17-19 centuries gold standard developed.
    + after WW2 and Bretton woods conference, most countreis adopted fiat currencies fixed to the US dollar, which was in turn fixed to Gold. 
    + 1971, US terminated convertibility into gold. may currencies depegged, and became unbacked. only backed by govt declaration and being able to exchange for GS. also backed by taxes.

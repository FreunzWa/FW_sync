###### Stock market crashes


# Basics
- sudden dramatic decline in stock prices across a significant number of areas of the stock market == loss of paper wealth. 
- generally descibred to be social phenomena: economic events combine with crowd behaviour in a postiive feedback loop == selling by some of market participants incites more to sell.
- no specific definition, but usu around double digit percentage losses in an index over a period of a couple of days
- different from bear markets (occurs over months-years), however a crash can cause a bear market.
- rf:
    + prolonged period of rising stock prices, excessive economic optimism
    + P/E ratios exceed long term averages
- flash crash
    + extremely short amount of time decline in stock prices. often highly volatile == may recover.
    + usu @high frequency traiding and black box trading. the recovery can occur extremely soon afterward.s

# terms
- soft landing: part of the business cycle when economy moves from growth to slow growth phase to potentially flat, possibly avoiding the recessionary period. usually @governments attempt to slow down inflation 

# how stock market crashes affect the economy
- self: decreased stock prices == less capital raised for the company == forced into contraction == UE == less AD and recession. (this is somewhat true, but obviosuly would only affect business raising shares)
- economic effects:
    + wealth effect: people see their stock prices falling == less likely to spend. however this effect is weak @only 10% of households have shares
    + effect on pensions: @investemnt trust or pension fund == pension holders may feel the need to save more
    + confidence: people seeing stocks falling will be more hesitant to spend as they may think this corresponds to potential econmic stagnation
    + investment: businesses raising shares can do so for less money == less investment/ less expansion. however this is limited, as many businesses do this instead by getting bank loans rather than share options. 
    + short-termism: firms listed on stock exhcange with falling prices may feel obliged to increase dividends for share holders to compensate, they may make cuts in other areas of the business (eg wages) that impact workers/ productin.

- entered bear market suddenly in late 2000-2001 which continued through to 2002, by this time most dot com bubbles had gone bust
- bubble @sepculative fad-based investemnt that was self fulffilling, adn the burst resulted when the firms were unable to make a profit -- thus the actual positions were fundamentally worthless and would only last until the collective sentiment fell, and the hgiehr the prices get the less justifiable the positions are, and as soon as there is a degree of price correctiont he rpice crashes rapidly, leaving many investors locked into positions because there are no buyers. 
- the actual trigger was dell and cisco announcing large sell orders on their stocks, which triggered panic selling amongst investors. 
- speculative bubbles are very difficult to recognise whilst happening but retrospectively their failure is self evident

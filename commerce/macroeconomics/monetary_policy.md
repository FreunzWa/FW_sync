###### Monetary policy
- central bank   controls the cost of very short term borrowing OR the money supply, targeting a goal inflation rate/ interest rate to ensure price stability == trust in the currency. 
- monetary policy attempts to:
    + reduce UE
    + stabilise the gross domestic product year to year
    + maintain predictable exchange rates with other currencies. 
- importantly, is distinct from FISCAL POLICY, which refers to govt policy (taxation, govt spending, associated borrowing)

# Types of monetary policy
- Expansionary
    + stimulate economy w/ low interest rates, increased money supply in the economy.
        * the hope is that with low interest rates, and increased money supply, will entice businesses to expand and hire workers == less UE. 
- Contractionary
    + maintains higher inerest rates and reduces rate of increase of the money supply. decreases inflation. 
    + may cause UE, depressed borrowing and spending by consumers. this can cause recession if implemented too vigorously.

# Central bank
- aka reserve bank, monetary authority
- institution that manages the currency, money supply, interest rates of a state. it aims to meet certain targets in the short term
- in this way it oversees the commerical banking system. 
- has complete control over changing the monetary base (increase or decrease), through printing money or increased electronic funds. 
- usually fairly insulated from policitical interfference. 
- functions:
    + implement monetary policy
    + setting the official interest rate
    + controlling money supply
    + lender of last resort
    + manage gold reserves
    + regulates commercial banking industry

# Policy instruments open to the central bank 
- Conventional instruments (3 main tools of monetary policy)
    + open market operations
        * controls amount of money in circulation by the buying and selling of financial instruments (eg treasury bills, govt bonds, corporate bonds, foreign currencies). all of these transactions are convertible to currency == more or less circulating money. 
        * Can use this to change interest rates 
            - (FOR EXAMPLE, in expansionary policy == purchase govt debt, ie giving govt a loan == more cash in circulation. thus more money to lend out == cheaper @more supply == interest rates will decrease)
    + set discount rate (called the cash rate in Australia/ NZ, or the bank rate)
        * can also increase or decrease the interest rate it charges on discounts or overdrafts (that is the loans from the central bank to commercial banks) == this will change the amount of money commerical banks can afford to borrow from the central bank == more/ less money in circulation. (@more money central banks == interest rates will decrease)
    + set reserve requirements
        * refers to teh total proportion of toal liabilities that banks must keep on hand overnight. (vaults or in teh central bank). this is not usually done first line @causes uncertainty @immediate increase in liquidity. involves setting requiremnt of funds in the bank, not in loans. in expansionary policy, the Central bank can lower the RR == more funds freed for investment purposes/ loans == economic activity.

# Unconconventional monetary policy
- occurs @close to zero bound with concerns of deflation. policies includes:
    + credit easing
        * CB purhcase private secotr assets to improve liquidity
    + quantitiate easing
    + forward guidance
    + signaling


-----------------------------------------------
# Discount rate
- Setting a high discount rate (contractionary)
    + means that to borrow money from the RB, the commercial banks have to pay higher DRs on that money == cannot afford to take out as much loans == decreased money available for loaning == increased interest rates on the money (as supply has decreased, and demand the same paratis cerebis)

- output:
    + quantity of goods/ services produced in a given time period by an entity. (the goods may be used as input for further production)
    + 'national' output refers to all the goods/ services that a country produces, a higher national output correlates well with the country's wealth.
        * measured in GDP per capita
- input
    + aka 'factors' of production. 
    + what is used in the production to produce output (finished good/ services that are ready for consumption)
    + primary factors: land, labor, capital goods
    + secondary factors: material and energy (require primary factors as inputs)

- financial instruments

- policy instrument
    + interventions made by govt/ cenral bank in local/ national economies which are intended to achieve outcomes. 

- discretionary policy
    + ad hoc judgement of policymakers as oposed to policy set by predetermined rules (ie use of discretion in making decisions or creating new legislation)

- Okun's law
    + relationship between unemployment and losses in country production
    + for every 1% increase in unemployment == GDP 2% lower than potential GDP. approximation because other factors of course affect national output.

- inflation
    + sustained price increasea in teh general price level of goods and services in an economy oer a period of time. 
    + @price increases == each unit of currency will buy fewer goods/ services == inflation reflects reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money. 
    + tracked with a standard 'basket' of goods (the consumer price index)

- deflation
    + negative inflation rate
    + == ++purchasing power of money but the value of goods decreases == less incentive to produce output == collapse of the economy

- nominal rigidity
    + resistance of nominal price to change. complete rigidity @nominal price fixed for a relevant period of time. 
    + partial nominal rigidityy  occurs wheen price varies in nominal terms but not as much as it would if it were perfectly flexible and determine by aggregate demand. 
    + wages are very sticky in the downwards direction as businesses are more likely to lay workers off than lower wages past a certain value. 

- real value 
    + real value of a good or other entity has been adjusted for inflation
    + contrast to nominal value

- nominal value
    + nominal values are those not adjusted for inflation

- national accounts
    + accounting techniques for measuring the economic activity of a nation. 

- nominal value
    + monetary values tha thave not been adjusted for inflations. 

- nominal rigidity
    + (aka price stickiness). important in macroeconomic theory as it is one of the factors that can prevent an economy from reaching equilibrium in teh long run. 
    + for example nominal wage rigidity in settings of govt regulation to prevent wage flexibility eg with a minimum wage. 
    + a 'price spell' is a period during which the price of a given item does not change. 
    + a contradicton to CE, in that it may be a factor that prevents markets from being totally self correcting. 
    + a given sector with nominal rigidity affects other sectors with relatively flexible prices and can prevent the marrkket from clearing.

- market clearing
    + no leftover supply or demand for a given market.
    + classical economics suggest that prices will always adjust up or down to ensure market clearing

- divison of labor
    + segregation of labor force into different fields so that workers may specialise and be more productive. 

- velocity of money
    + refers to how fast money passes on from one holder to teh next.
        * income velocity: freq at which avg same unit of currency is used to purchase newly deomsetcially produced goods and services wihtin a given time period. 
    + measurement are usually indirect

- full employment 
    + Full employment means that everyone who wants a job can have work hours they need on "fair wages" Because people switch jobs, full employment means a stable rate of unemployment around 1 to 2 per cent of the total workforce
    + however not necessarily 100% employment, there may be some natural rate of UE


- aggregate demand (aka domestic final demand)
    + total demand for final goods and services in economy @point in time. 

- deficit spending
    + the amount by which the spending exceeds reenue over a period of time. 
    + controversial, some believe spending money you dont have is always bad policy, others consider it necessary for countercyclical measures against the business cycle.

- aggregate demand/ aka domestic final demand
    +  Aggregate demand is an economic measurement of the sum of all final goods and services produced in an economy, expressed as the total amount of money exchanged for those goods and services. Since aggregate demand is measured by market values, it only represents total output at a given price level and does not necessarily represent quality or standard of living.
    +  equal to GDP, share the sae equaiton.
    
- aggregate product/ GDP
    + measure of market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period fo time

- natural rate of UE
    + 'The natural rate of unemployment, when an economy is in a steady state of "full employment", is the proportion of the workforce who are unemployed'

- reserve requirment (cash reserve ratio)
    + central bank regulation, sets the minimum amount of reserves to be held by a commercial bank. generally no less than a specified percentage of hte amnt of deposit liabilities the commerical bank has. 
    + is often used as a tool in monetary policy, as it changs the amount of funds available for banks to make loans with. 

- economic rent
    + economic rent is any payment to an owner or factor of production in excess of the costs needed to bring that factor into production. (for example wages to pay worker to operate means of production)

- expansionary policy
    * An expansionary policy is a macroeconomic policy (usu monetary) that seeks to encourage economic growth or combat inflationary price increases by expanding the money supply, lowering interest rates, increasing government spending or cutting taxes.

- liquidity trap
    + Keynesian economics, liquidity preference may become virutally absolute so that everyone prefers to have more liquid holdings (ie cash) == everyone hoards == economics stagnation adn reduced output 

- liquidity preference
    + an investor demands a higher interset rate on securities with higher risk, (that is less liquid than cash).

- liquidity
    + propert of a market wherein an individual vendor or buyer can make the transaction rapidly without causing for a drastic chane in teh assets price. 
    + an illiquid market: selling quickly comes at the price of a greatly reduced price @selling, or an increased price @buying. 

- fiat currency (fiat money)
    + money which has no intrinsic value, established by govt regulation. 

- seignoiorage
    + the difference between the value of money and the cost to produce it and distribute it.

    + economic system in which transactions between private entities are free from overarching regulation. 

# Key people
- John Keynes
    + 1883-1946 economist who ++field of macroeconomics, developed principle of the business cycle.
- Adam Smith

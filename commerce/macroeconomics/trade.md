###### Trade
- key basis is the theory of competitive advantage, that countries or states specialisiang in different production industries (eg layer 2 and layer 3 sectors) are more efficient economically @share produce. 

# Trade war
- economic conflict @protectionist policy in which imposition of trade barriers by states causes further impostiion of trade barriers == continuous. 

# Trade conflicts/ war
- trade barrier
    + government induced restrictions on trade. 
        * tariff barriers: impost of financial burden on trade
        * non-tariff barriers (NTBs): 
            - any obstacle to international trade that is not an export or import duty. 
            - three types:
                + assistance poicies
                    * help domestic firms
                        - domestic subsidies (helps local business produce to compete against international exports)
                + protectionist policies
                    * help domestic firms at expense of international firms
                        - import quotas (maximum imports)
                        - anti-dumping laws (prevent artifical price lowering from international company to prevent obtaining greater market share)
                + non protectionist policies
                    * labeling, packaging, sanity and phytosanity rules, animal and plant inspections - thus banning certain imports based on the way they are produced/ packaged.
    + economists agree that this is detrimental to overall economic efficiency @lose comparative advantage == stagnation
- free trade
    + the lack of government induced barriers to trade. maximise theory of competitive advantage



# Terms
- embargo
    + outright prohibition of trade of a certain commodity

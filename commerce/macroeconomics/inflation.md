###### Inflation
@increasing prices == @more money in circaultion == each unit of money purchases fewer goods. (reduction in purchasing power - loss of real value for purchasing a strandardized bag of goods)

Inflation is also used to refer to an increase in teh general price level, not just as a reference to expansion of the money supply. 

inflation may be used in a more limited sense for a given asset class/ commodities class

# Inflation terms
- disinflation (reduction in inflation rates)
- hyperinflation (out of control inflationary spiral)
- stagflation (inflation, slow economic growth and high UE)

# Causes
- excessive growth fo the *money supply* out of proportion to economic growth. 
- low-moderate inflation: 
    + @flucutations in general demand for GS.


# Advantages of mild inflation
- @mild inflation (<2% per annum) == reduction in severity of recessions

# History
- influence of commodity supply on the general price level. eg @new discovery of gold == gold price decreases == everything else relatively becomes more expensive

# Disadvantages of inflation
- increased opportunity cost of holding money
    + @inflation (esp rapid) == potentially discouraging investments (hoarding with a liquidity trap) == -=consumption/ spending == economic stagnation == reduction in national output.

# Measurement
- inflation rate
    + the annual percentage change in the general price index (usually the consumer price index CPI)
    + track CPI (as it inflation refers to the overall increase in pirce of GS)


# Policy measures against inflation
- policy in Keynesian economcics is considered to be vital in controllling the inflationary rate and preventing a liquidity trap @hyperinflation. 
- policies controlled @central banks. 
- key monetary policies:
    + interest rate
    + open market operations
    + setting of bank reserve ratio requirements (to influence amount of loaning the bank can do to influence consumer spending)



---------------------------
### Theories on inflation
- Monetarist
    + most significant factor is how fast the money supply grows or shrinks.
    + govt policy/ spending is ineffective in controlling inflation. especially in the long run.



-------------------------
Cost-push inflation
- @rising prices == demands for incresaed wages == further increases in earnng poewr == increasd demand and prices rise further. 

### Effects
- general
    + @-=purchasing power == values for GS increases while unit value decreases.

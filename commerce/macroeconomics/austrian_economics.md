###### Austrian economics

# basics
- neoclassical economic theory, attempt to reject government intervention in free markets, favoring more laissez faire economic activity. 
- based on rational expectations hypothesis and efficient market hypothesis. both have been largely done away with by the 08 crisis
- influenced free market reforms of Raegan/ Thatcher of the 1980s
- probably contributed to the woefully bad decisions of the US treasury in preventing the GFC as they took a non interventional approach when an intervnetional approach was clearly required.

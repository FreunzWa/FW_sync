###### Output
- the quantity of GS produced in a given time period by firm/ state/ individual, regardless of what the GS are used for (consumption or used for further production)
- national output (measured eg @net national income, GDP, GNI)
    + equivalent to a country's wealth, but a better measure of quality of living is the GDP per capita pur purchasing power parity (ie GDP per person). GDP per capita does not reflect differences in teh cost of living and inflation rates of a given state. 
- GDP/ GNI comparisons used to determine how much of the GDP represents domestic or international activity.
- an economic output is the result of a process that uses factors of production (inputs) to produce a product that is available for use or further sale. 

# Relation to income
- @produce output == get a identical amount of income to the one that produced it (@they own the output)


# National output
- National output (GDP) = Consumption + Investments + Govt investments + Govt spending + (exports - imports)
- most commonly measured @GDP, main challenge is to avoid counting the same product more than once. 
- if one is to calculate national output by counting every GS, then will count the same GS multiple times and its multiple stages of production. 
- to get around this, the problem is conceptualised in terms of 'value addition': the value that is added to a given input/ output at each stage of its development.
- can also just consider final sales (the expenditure method), this method is used more widely.
    + this must include all expenditure by households, but not all expenditure by firms as firms purchase products and then reprocess them. 
    + thus only expenditures on output that are not expected to be used in the short run are used.  
- imports must be elimiated from GDP as output being purchased from overseas as this is money going away from the country, as otherwise the GDP equation would also include free inputs to some of the eventual outputs. 
- must also add the total value produced by exports as this is still value that is going back to the countryotherwise these end outputs would be lost inexplicably. 

# Fluctuations in National output
- fluctuates over time? causes?

# GDP calculations
- difficulties in calculating @risk of double counting
- methods of calculating:
    + 1: final value of GS produced in time period
    + 2: value added
    + 3: sum of incomes


# GDP
- GDP deflator = Nominal GDP / Real GDP
    + GDP deflator is a measure of inflation/ deflation with respect to base year. however this is not standardized by CPI basket of goods, changes year to year based on expenditure.

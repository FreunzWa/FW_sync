# Basics
+ types of unemployment:
        * classical (real wage) unemployment: @wages too high == employrs higher less workers. however other theories suggest that @++wages == demand is higher for general goods == actually more employment.
        * frictional unemployment: occurs due to latency period in finding a new job. ('aka' search unemployment). important to reduce as much as possible as this can be substantial to economy @long periods. 
        * structural unemployment: @shifts in infrastructure/ emphasis on different sectors == less jobs open for people with certain skills. (similar to frictional @both involve matching workers with job vacacnies.) mismatch between open positions and people with given skill sets.
        * involuntary UE
- an ideal UE rate will depend on the economic policy of the state in question, but will always be >0 @frinctional unemployment, but there should even be some real wage UE. Natural rate of UE usu sit between 4.5-5

# Theories
- Keynesian theory
    + emphasises cyclical nature of UE (business cycle) recommends  govt interventions to stimulate economy to increase demand for workers
- Classical economics
    + argue that market mechanisms are best for resolving UE. aruge AGAINST interventions (eg minimum wages, taxes, unionisation) with thought that these discourage hiring of workers.
- Marxian theory
    + believes UE is inherent to the capatalist system, as the masses are forced to fight for fewer positions with lower and lower wages to survive
    + overall UE is actually profitable, as it increases demand for jobs wiht lower wages == decreased wages as market clearing. (reduction in economic rent)

# Classical UE (real wage UE)
CAUSES
    - occurs @real wages for job set above market clearing level == more job seekers than there are places... to a point. 
    - ... however high wages will also increase consumption == more jobs and less UE. this will be the cases if the economy is going well enough for there to be more job vacancies available than there are people looking for jobs.
    - OR @real wages lower than real prices of living. ESPECIALLY when there is a public welfare system which provides enough to live on, people may not need to work unless real wages are high. 
    - GOVT. REGULATION
        + eg @minimum wage laws == low value labor is overvalued in comparison to market clearing value == less positions to offer == ++UE


# Cyclical UE
- Cyclical (Keynesian UE)/ Deficient-demand
    + occurs @not enough AD in teh economy == cannot provide jobs for everyone who wants to work (not enough demand for goods and services == les production required)
    + sticky wages == wages do not fall to market clearing level == mass UE
    + possible to abolish cyclical UE @increase AD.


# Long term UE
- UE lasting for longer than one year for a given individual. 
- Usually a manifestation fo structural UE

# Measurement of UE
- there are very variable ways of measuring UE, sometimes making comparison difficult
- UE rate = 100 * UE workers / Total labor force 
    + UE workers are those not working but willing to work. must be actively seeking within past 4 weeks. 
    + there are variations of this calculation based on who is defined to be 'UE'
    + definitions of those considered UE vary based on location 


   
# Complications of UE
- individual
    + ++homelessness/ cannot afford mortgage 
    + increasde health problems, mental and organic. ++rates of medication use/ hospitalisation.
    + may cause underemployment (lack of utilisation of skills)
- social
    + under utilisation of all resources, burden health system. 
    + loss of human capital @workers can lose skills after UE for a long period. 
    + ++xenophobia @workers feel that foreigners are stealing their jobs. 
    + crime
    + revolution

# benefits of UE
- people are available for hire, no headhunting from exxisting employers. 
- averts overt inflation, as it keeps wages in check (as there is competittion for roles the wages will be forced down due to increased demand)
- full employment sometimes is not good @workers may shirk (no threat of UE) == decreasead productivity. 
- some UE is good @reducing the UE below the level of natural employment will cause inflation (wages rise, prices increase, general inflation) and decreased productivity @there is no threat of UE.


# Measures for reducing UE
- demand side solutions
    + increasing demand for labor @++AD. 
    + +=AD @
        * increasing wages (increased consumption)
        * short term: increased money supply (will increase short term demand, but long term is negated)
    + aid to the unemployed to get jobs (social welfare)
- supply side solutions
    + removal of minimum wage so workers can be more competitive and work for the going price rather than the minimum wage. 
    + this also increases long term growth in employment @reduction of labor costs. @labor costs less == can produce more == more people hired. 
    + reduce regulation

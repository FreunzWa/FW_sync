###### Marxian economics
- considered distinct from marxian socioeconomic theory advocating for socialist revolution. 
- theory that the only source of profit is exploitation of workers (surplus value theory)

# Labour theory of value
- value of GS the socially necessary labour time invested in it. (labor theory of value). + value of any instruments of labor/ raw materials used (depreciated)
    + caveats that the item must not be a useless item.
    + value determined @the amount of labor an average worker would put in.
- surplus value: the difference in actual value a worker's work produces and the amount paid for the labor.
- considers moneys' value derived from the labor costs associated (eg the smelting and miniting fo the metals involvd. )

# Means of production
- the subjects of labour and the instruments of labour are together the means of production. 

# Technical progress' effect
- @greated mehcanisation/ automation of development, teh value for GS fall (@less labor required to produce the same GS)
- this can allow for increased surplus labor time and increased rate of surplus value. 

-------------------------
# Criticisms
- value theory 
- inconsistency in theories

# NeoMarxian
- stresses monopolistic rather than the competitive nature of capitalism

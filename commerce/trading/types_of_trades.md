###### Types of trades

# Short selling
- bets on decline in security price
- borrowing a security from broker then sells them immediately on open market, then waits until the price falls (whilst paying interest during this period). the stock is bought back at the new price. if the stock falls then the trader can give the no of shares back to the lender, and the difference in price will be what is made. 
- used for
    + sepculation on downward movement of stock
    + hedge the downside risk of a long position in the same security or related one. 
- requires margin account with margin interest incurred depending on long the position is held for, significantly risky so only should be done by experienced @unlimited losses because the effective upper limit for stock is limitles. 
- originally declared legal 1934 with the uptick rule, so that you could only short a stock if it occured during an uptic from the previous sale (to prevent succesessive shorting which otherwise could artificially force stock price down )
- however the ability to proft in a beaer market at the expense of others seemed unethical to many. 
- the uptick rule was eventually eliminiated in 2007, following studies that the regulation did little to curb abusive behaviour and had potential to limit market liquidity. 
- since 2008 as of the GFC an alternative uptick rule was enforced, which does not apply to all securities and is only triggered by a 10% or greater price drop from previous close. 
- naked short selling
    + illegal practise of short selling shares which do not exist. usu have to borrow the stocks before selling it. illegal after 08 crisis, but continues @loopholes and discrepancies between paper and electric systems. 
    + impact: can increase liquidity

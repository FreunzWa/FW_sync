###### Market for lemons (Adverse selection)
- 1970 paper by George Akerlof economist. 
- describes how quality of goods degrade in market @information asymmetry between buyers and sellers. 
- "lemon" is a car that has been found to be defective after purchase.


# Process
- buyers are willing to spend average price of a peach and lemon, they dont know which cars are which
- however as sellers have information to which cars are which, and thus only want to sell the car when it is a lemon. this forces sellers of peaches away from the market.
- thus the price offered by buyers will decrease as the quality of market goods declines. 
- adverse selection == degraded quality of product.

# Adverse selection
- adverse selection occurs inversely (where the buyer has more knowledge about their own health) in the health insurance industry (esp @dangerous jobs) == forces the premiums to increase. 
- contrast with moral hazard
- one of the two types of market failure associated with insurance.

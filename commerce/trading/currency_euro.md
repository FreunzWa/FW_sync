###### The Euro

# why it was introduced
- introduced by the EU bloc for the following reasons:
    + reduce currency risk during exchange/ trade between member nations
    + make travel easier/ encourage travel within member states. 
    + increases free market competition between memebr states == ++production 

# which countries did not adopt
- The UK
- Denmark, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden

# Disadvantags of the Euro
- some economists believe the Euro was a mistake becuase the EU member states are not sufficiently homogenous
- asymmetric shock:
    + essentially having a centalised currency takes monetary decision making away from member governments. 
    + having a single currency for many different countries with very different sates of economy can be destructive. monetary policy cannot simply be implemented htrough the use of the Euro (eg through changing interest rates) which can cause asymmetric problems for different countries within the EU
    + for instance if one member country enters recession it may want to decrease interest rates, however this may not be desirable for other member states. 


# Implementation
- was originally an overarching intermediary currency used for exchange between countries. 
- within 3 years most countries had adopted it in the EU

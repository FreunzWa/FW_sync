###### Futures market

# Basics
- exchange traded forward contract.
- a tradeable financial contract obligating buyer to purchase an asset, or the seller to sell an asset. predetermined date and price. 
- it is a type of forward contract in that the settlement occurs in the future. 
- the underlying asset is usually a commodity or financial instrument.
- it is a form of derivative product as its value is a function of underlying assets.
    + other derivaties: options, swaps, covered warrants
- in the contract, there is counter party risk: (risk of the other party wont be able to uphold their end of the contract). 
- trading  forward contracts occurs on the futures exchange. the stock market absorbs the counter party risk as there is arbitrage in exchanging the contractural agreements (ie the buyer pays more than the seller gets, the intermediate is taken by the exchange).
    + the stock exhcnage also requires a margin to be put up (usually 2-20% of the price depending on volatility) to ensure that market moves can be absorbed and the contract filled. 
    + futures are usually used to hedge against price movements in the underlying commodity

# History
- originally only for agricultural commodities, but has extended since 1972 to financial futures, including currency futrues, interest rate futrues, stock market index futures. 
    + started in 1972 with currency futures
    + 1975 interest rate contacts
    + stock index futures in 1982
- originally was used to mitigate risk of price/ exchange rate ovements by allowing parties to fix prices. this benefits both prices as it protects the buyer for soaring prices (due to high demand for instance) and it protects the seller if the prices become low (due to competition for instance). this allows locking in prices in advacne, which causes stability in the prices at supermarkets etc
    + flucutatons in the agricultural commodity might be dependent on weather for instance/ changing consumer demand for certain foods. 

# Terminology
- forward price: agreed price in the future
- delivery date: the date on which the transaction is said to occur.
- delivery:
    + physical delivery: amount specified of underlying asset physically delivery to the exchange, and then from the exchange to teh contract holders. done only in minority of cases.
    + cash settlement: made baed on underlying reference rate (receive the loss/ gain associated with their position)
- price discovey: process of determiing the price of an asset in marketplace through supply and dmeand. 

# Margin in futrues contract
- margin types
    + initial margin: percentage of the forward price
    + maintenance margin:
- if the price moves against one party then the price is corrected, however the margin accounts correct the imbalance in price. prevent walk outs. a margin call is when the margin account falls below teh intiial margin, must refill the account with money to get back to the initial margin 

# Functions of the financial futures market
- price discovery
- hedging

# Contango & Backwardation
- contango: 
    + just means price of asset in future > spot price
    + normal state of market
    + people are willing to pay more than the future expected price for something in the future. this is associated with commodities because the buyer does not have to pay the associated storage costs in the meantime (carry costs), and also lost opportunity cost (no interest)
    + if a market is in contango:
        * it indicates that the forward/ futrues curve is upward sloping, and the futures price are decreasing to meet the spot price. 
- Backwardation
    + inverted futures curve
        * declining commodity futures curve. the most common reason is short term [shortage of the commodity] or sudden demand surge. {eg an oil crisis}. usually doesnt last for as long, temporary condition of the market.
        * can also come from traders in teh futrues market selling futures as a discount, so that they can avoid as much volatility as possible (Normal backwardation)
    + backwardation refers to increasing slopes of the futures curves towards the spot price. 

# Novation
- writing a new contract to replace an old contract (novation)

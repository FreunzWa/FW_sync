###### Relation between Macroeconomics and stock prices for companies
- macroeconomic events affect stock prices, based on what event has occurred and what sector the stock in question is from. 
- a negative event may also be a trigger for the start of an erosion of confidence in a particular stock or the entire market and thus start a bear market. 

# How does trade affect stock prices
- when trade is booming with limited tarrifs exporting companies do well, as well as sectors such as materials, industrials, technology that require overseas imports for manufacturing.
    + however, trade can result in significant competitin for local companies which may make business difficult for them as the overseas country occupies a larger market share
- with trade conflict, materials, industrials, tech sectors are hit badly, esp @require imports from China/ other countries == makes production more expensive. 

# Time of the year
- May-October: Typically the more defensive times of the year, with higher levels of correction

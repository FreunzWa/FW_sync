###### US economy

# US National debt
- As of Feb 2019 exceeded 22 trillion. 
- 2/3 of the debt is to the public (includes buyers of US treasury bills, notes and bonds)
- the debt now exceeds US total economic output, while in 1988 it was only half. this decreases confidence for overseas investment. 
- biggest increase in debt with the GFC, policies under Obama halted the 2008 crisis. 
- overseas influence:
    + countires like Japan and China buy US debt in the form of treasury notes to keep their currencies low relative to the dollar, they lend to America so it will keep buying heir exports. 

# How debt affects the economy
- short run, economy and voters benefit from defecit == drives economic growth/ increase in output. 
- long term, debt holders can demand larger interest payments @to get compensation for the increased risk that they will not be repaid
    + as the demand for us debt/ treasuries falls == increase in interest rates == economy eventually slows.
    + lower demand for treasurys == dollar value falls (dollar value is tied to treasury securities) == foreign holders get paid back in a currency that is worht les == decreases demand further.
    + the debt interest repayments will become insurmountable.

###### Machine learning notes

# Machine learning techniques
[boosting methods; "turning a weak learner into a strong one.". builds the model in a stepwise fashion, it reduces the bias and variance in supervised learning that convert weak learers to strong ones. ]
[weak learner; classification accuracy is above chance, but just barely. - i.e. only a slight correlation]
- gradient boosting
    + for regression and classification, the model is an ensemble of weak prediction models, typicallyu decisionj trees. 

XGBoost - an open source gradient boosting library

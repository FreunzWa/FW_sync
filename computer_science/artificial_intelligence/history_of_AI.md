###### History of AI

# Basics - adapted @wikipedia
- began ancient started @purely philo, w/ classical philosophers atttempt to describe process of human thinking as mechnical manipulation of symbols -- AI is based on the assumption that human thought can be mechanised. 
    + developed @Aristotle (syllogism), Euclid, Al-Khwaizmi (algebra and the algorithm)
- then eventual creation of Turing Complete machines to emulate any conceivable process of mathematical deduction.
- with discovery @brain was network of electrical neurons that fired impulses all or nothing, with the turing complete machine, believed electronic brain could be made.
- automatons built, believed imbued with reael minds @powerful crafting/ spirituality.
- field of AI as an academic discipline began 1956 Darthmouth college -- started but underestimated difficulty of project. 
- robotics: John Hopkins' Beast and W. Grey Walter's turtles.
- Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch analysed networks of artificial neurons and showed how they could perform simplle logical lfuncitons.. paper "logical calculus of ideaes immanent in nervous activity"
- Game AI started 1951, Checkers and Chess, game AI continued to be a mark of progresss of AI
- 1973 AI winter began @underwhelming results 
    + biggest problems of combinatorial explosion, limited computer power, lacking commonsense, moravec's paradox
- Japan early 1980s (Fifth generation project) began again with ++funding from govt but failed @lack of hardware procesesing pwer
- second AI winter @1987-1993 @economic bubble -- 
- now @more powerful computers == ML is applied to many fieelds == booming in early 21 st century.

###### Artificial intelligence - basics
    Artificial intelligence - intelligence demonstrated @machines in contrast t to natural intelligence. 
    "AI effect" - as machines' processing power increases == tasks considered to require intelligence are removed from the definition of AI "Tesler's Tjheorem" == AI is whatever has not been done yet (eg optical character recognition.)
- some definitions
    + a system’s ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.”

# Introduction
- aka machine intelligence, intelligence @machines contrast @natural human intelligence.
- colloquial use is desecribed machines that mimic cognitive functions
- "AI effect", discount behaviour of AI by arguing not reael intelligence. "Oh, thats just computation", as soon as AI successfully solves a problem the problem is no longer a part of AI -- eg optical character recognition
- distinguish from machine learning, which is a function the AI programs may use to improve their algorithms
- traditional goals of AI research
    + reasoning
    + knowledge represeentation
        * creaetion of ontology
    + planning
        * ability to recognise choices and predict how they will affect the environment, and then assign a value -- utility to each possible decision
    + learning
        * machine learning -- a process by which a probgram improves its algorithms through experience.
    + NLP
        * ability to read and understand human langugage. information retrieval, summarisation
    + perception
        * ability to use inptu ffrom sensors and anallyse the input for features
    + motion/ manipulation
    + general intelligence

# Basics of how AI works in principles
- AI when applied to a problem can learn new heuristics @they have worked well in the past, and then doing those things more. 
- with enough computing power can compare every hypothesis and llearn that a new heuristic
- however @cannot consideer everything @combinatorial expllosion == must only consider important possibilitiees. 
- can use learning algorithms to learn behaviour -- but be careful with data used @can overfit
- however AI lacks commonsense reasoning currently @often resorts to non human algorithmic models to preddict the world.

# Quotes
- "AI is whatever has not been done yet"
- "Human intelligence cna bee so prescisely described that a machine can be m,ade to simulate it"
- Moravec's paradox:
    + discovery that contrary to traditional assumptions high level reasoning requires littlee computation by low level motor skills reuqire enormous computation



# Brief history of AI
- academic discipline in 1956
- AI winter @loss of funding.


# Types of AI learning
- fitness functions (evolutionary, natural selection systrem)
- reinforcement learnings

# Machine learning
- supervised vs. unsupervised llearning.

# Approaches to researching AI
- disagree @whether to approach from human biollogy/ psychology to simulate natural intelligence. 
- unsure @whether requires huge data computation or some simple elegant principles using logic and optimisation





# Frequently used terms
- 'deep learning'
    + part of a broader family of ML methods based on artificial neural nettworks (ANNs) - convolutional neural networks
    + either supervised/ semi/ unsupervised
- tensor
    + mathematical object similar to vector, but more general. an algebraic object reelated to vector space
    + in tf they are implemented as multidimensional data arrays

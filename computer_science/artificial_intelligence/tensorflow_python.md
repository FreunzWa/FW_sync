###### Tensorflow python

# Terms
- vectors
    + matrices, ordered collection of numbers as a column matrix. multidimensional. directional. 
    + vritually represented as arrows
    + has both magnitude (the length) and direction (the orientation angle). can be used to represent forces, or areas (eg the length proportional to the area, and the direction perp to the surface)
    + part of a wider family called tensor.
    + a vector can be expressed as the sum of unit vectors for each component
- plane vectors
    + most straightforward tensor seetuip, endpoint at 0,0 pointing to coordinates.
- unit vectors
    + magitude 1 vectors (denoted with hat)
- component vectors
    + vectors whose sum gives rise to the sum vector
- tensor
    + a generalised form fo a vector (where the components scalar values are generalilsed)
    + ranks of tensors.
    + scalars are of rank 0, no direction. can be represented @one number

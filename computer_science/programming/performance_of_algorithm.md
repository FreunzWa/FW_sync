# Big O notation/ Function complexity
- Big O notation (Bachmann- Landau notation)
    + describes limiting behaviour @function when argument tend toward particular valuee/ infinity
    + classify algorithms how running time grows as input size grows
    + good for analysing algorithms for efficiency


# Time complexity
- computational complexity thatt describes mant fo time takes to run algorithm
- usu consider worst case time complexity
- denoting
    + O(n) linear time algorithm
    + O(n^a) polynomial time algorithm where a>1

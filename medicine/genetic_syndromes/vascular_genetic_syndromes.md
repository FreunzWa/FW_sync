    Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome)


# Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome) HHT/OWR
- basics
    + AD vascular disorder. characterised @epistaxis, GI bleeding, Fe def anaemia, mucocutaneous telangiectasia.
    + affects pulmonary, GI, cererbral vasculature, skin , hepatic
    + includes AV shunts, formation of nidal AVMs (including pulmonary vasculature), telangiectasia formation superficially.
- medical
    + mx
        * @risk for VTE @polycythaemia features
    + 50% pulmonary affected, 1/3 hepatic involvement, 10% cerebral involvement.
    + GI involvement etc other sites become increasinly involved @age
    + @pregnancy == 1% risk of mortality per pregnancy
    + nathx:
        * chronic severe bleeds == Fe deficiency anaemia
        * @cerebral AVM == %hemorrhagic stroke
        * @hepatic AVM == high output cardiac failure, 
        * @pulmonary PAVMs == the blood cannot be oxygenated == polycythaemia features. 
    + complications
        * Fe deficiency anaemia
        * increasde risk of ischaemic stroke @fe deficiency
        * PAVMs == hemothorax/ haemoptysis
        * cerebral hemorrhage
- clinical
    + presentation
        * ++%epistaxis (usu found @child)
            - spontaneous recurrent epistaxis @nasal telangiectasia. severe. may require intervention. various triggers. 
        * 1/3%GI bleeding. 
            - %present with acute GI bleed episode, most common after 40 yrs
        * sx of Fe deficiency anaemia
        * telangiectasia on lips, fingers, oral mucosa
        * haemoptysis/ haemothorax
        * migraines
- treat
    + hepatic AVM %require liver transplantation.
    + transfusion %required @Fe deficiency anaemia
- investigate
    + bloods
        * platelet and coagulation are normal.
        * Fe deficiency (==elevated Factor 8 and shortened aPTT)
- diagnosis
    + confirm @genetic testing for SMAD4
    + features
        * spontaneous/ recurrent epistaxis
        * multiple mucocutaneous telangiectasia
        * first degree relative with HHT
        * visceral involvment

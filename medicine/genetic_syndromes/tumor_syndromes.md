###### Neoplastic syndromes

# VHL Syndrome (Von Hippel Lindau disease)
- basics
    + heritable AD syndrome == ++benign/ malignant tumors.
- class
    + 1A: -=pheos, ++risk of other lesion
    + 1B: -=pheos/-=RCCs, ++risk @other lesion
    + 2A: ++pheos/ -=RCC
    + 2B: ++pheos/ ++RCC
    + 2C: ++pheos, NO hemangioblastoma/ RCC 
- pathophysiology
    + VHL associated tumors
        * hemangioblastoma (CNS: brain, retina, spine), clear cell RCCs, pheos, pancreatic cystadenomas, endolymphatic sac tumors of middle ear, epididymal/ broad ligament cystadenomas.  
        * also ++Renal cysts
        * ELSTs: %bilateral middle ear slow growing lesions == conductive hearing loss
- clinical
    + present
        * usu @26 years
        * sx depend on tumor type/ location/ size etc/ presence of mets etc.
        * ELSTs: conductive hearing loss %bilateral/ %tinnitus 
- treat
    + surveillance @known genotype == early detection/ -=mets.
    + screening protocol begins @birth annually for remainder of life.
    + RCC: nephron sparing surgery (partial nephrectomy/ Rfreq Ablation), esp for <3cm lesions == not radical nephrectomy @low metastatic potential
- investigate
    + genetic testing: detect mutation in VHL gene == referral to specialist centres. %difficult to detect @mosaicism @lymphocytes may not carry mutation (the cells which are tested)
    + prenatal testing (@parent affected) @amniocentesis

# Neurofibromatosis (NF)
    NF1 (most common)
    NF2
    Schwannomatosis

# Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)
- basics
    + AD phakomatosis w/ full penetrance w/ variable expression @mosaicism. most common phakomatosis (neurocutaneous disorders)
    + aka von Recklinghausen disease
    + cutaneous neurofibromas, cafe-au-lait macules
- medical   
    + neurofibromin mutation NF1, == NF1 associated tumors
    + 50%inherited familial cases, otherwise de novo mutations
    + NF1 associated tumors - most common are the optic pathway gliomas.
        * other: rhabdomyosacroma, GIT stromal tumors, glomus, MPNSTs
- class
    + systemic vs. segmental (@mosaicism)
- clinical
    + presentation (in usual order of appearance)
        * 95% cafe-au-lait macules (flat pigmented congenital naevi). usu benign, but @>6 presnet == high risk of NF1. fade late in life.
        * axillary/ inguinal freckling, regions of skin apposition. appears @3-5 years.
        * lisch nodules (iris hamartomas) {95% <6 years old} 
        * cutaneous neurofibromas (peripheral nerve sheath tumors comprised of Schwann cells, fibroblasts) {nodular/ plexiform when matted}
        * NF1 associated tumors sx
    + %child delayed/ premature puberty @optic chiasm glioma == hypothalamic involvement
    + bone abnormalities:
        * %scoliosis, osteoporosis, 
    + cognitive/ development abnormality
    + %++seizures
    + macrocephaly
    + HTN from childhood
- diagnosis
    + clinical + imaging 2 or more of:(ONG/OPG, >6 cafe au lait spots, >2 neurofibromas + 1 plexiform NF, distinctive osseous lesions, >2 lisch nodules, axillary freckling, Fhx - CAFESPOT)
    + genetic testing to confirm diagnosis (++SN)
- Ddx/ 
    + must not mistake Legius syndrome for NG1, which has cafe-au-lait spots, %have learning disabilities/ developmental delay

# Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)
- basics
    + AD phakomatosis == predispose to ++tumors of the nervous system. 
    + most common is bilateral vestibular schwannoma, intracranial + spinal meningioma, ependymomas. 
    + >50% of cases @de novo mutations, without family histyr (@old parents == +=risk)
- medical
    + mut @merlin producing gene (NF2) == NF2. (merlin aka schwannomin is a tumor suppressor)    
    + neurological lesions
        * bilateral benign vestibular schwannoma in 95%.
        * schwannoma of other CN ~33%
        * 50%intracranial meningiomas, often multifocal
        * ~75%spinal tumors
        * ~66% peripheral neuropathy
    + skin lesions
        * ~60% cutaneous tumors, 45%skin plaques, 45%subcutaneous tumors
    + eye lesions
        * 70%cataracts, epiretinal %membranes, %retinal hamartomas
- clinical
    + usu present ~20 years of age
    + vestibular schwannoma == tinnitus/ progressive eharing loss eventually deafness/ balance dysfx. 
- diagnose
    + presence of one of (bil shcwannomas < 70 yrs, unilateral schwannoma < 70 yrs and 1d relative with NF2)
    + or two of (meningioma, non vestibular schwannoma, neurofibnroma, glioma, cerebral calcficiation and 1d relative with NF2 or unilateral vestibular schwannoma)
- investigate
    + radio
        * MRI imaging to scan CNS for tumors/ schwannoma formation in teh vestibular nerves

# Schwannomatosis
- basics
    + 3rd major form of NF. == multiple non cutaneous schwannomas in teh absence of vestibular schwannomas
- medical
    + the schwannomas are benign nerve sheath tumors, arise in CN, peripheral nerves, spinal roots. sit outside nerve == displace the nerve fibres. 
    + the schwannomas are usually located in the arms/ legs/ or %in the chest/ abdomen/ pelvis
- clinical
    + usu present @30yrs age with multiple schwannomas and pain as the PC, ~20% of pt have fhx. 
    + %muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, chronic pain (a mix of nociceptive and neuropathic features)
- radio
    + schwannomas %cannot be distinguished from NFs
    + MRI: STIR (short T1 iverson recovery) is often the best way to visualise the nerve sheath tumors. 
- diagnose
    + rule out the main differnetial of NF2 (negative genotyping, non family members and negative vestibular schwannoma on neuroimaging)
- treat
    + symptomatic relief, managing the chronic pain w/ pharmacological therpay (opioids/ pregabalin).
    + %surgery, usu only indicated @spinal nerve compression, impingement of organs. the removal of these tumors is risky @damage to surrounding nervous structures.

# Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (Wermer syndrome)
- basics
    + AD condition == ++risk of tumors of parathyroids, anterior pituitary, enteropancreatic endocrine cells (the 3 P's)
    + but can be associated with other tumors as well
    + diagnosed @at least 2 of the 3 primary MEN1 associated tumors
- medical
    + primary associated tumors:
        * parathyroid tumors (almost 100% penetrance by the age of 50, most common is simple hyperplasia rather than adenoma)
        * pituitary adenomas (15-20%), most common is lactotrophic tumors, but all cell types may be affected
        * pancreatic islet cell tumors (most malignant and life threatening type), 
            - gastrinomas are the most common pancreatic tumor (==ZES/ PUD). however less malignant than sporadic gastrinomas
            - insulinoma
            - nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors
    + other associated tumors (mostly gastrointestinal)
        * lipoma
        * angiofibromas
        * carcinoid tumors (esp thymic)
        * hepatic focal nodular hyperoplasia
        * adrenal cortical lesions
- clinical
- diagnose
    + 2+ of the 3 primary lesions associated with MEN1 muist be present. 
    + or genetic diagnosis.
    + or 1+ of the 3 primary when there is a first degree relative with MEN1
- investigate
    + screening @family member/ known MEN1
        * screen for symptoms (clinical screening)
        * serum calcium/ PTH/ prolactin to detect prolactinoma/ hyperpara
        * may do early imaging for pancreatic neoplasia, but minimise rad exposure by using endoscopic USS thereafter.

# Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (Sipple syndrome)
- basics
    + AD disorder == bilateral pheos, primary hyperparathyroidism, MTC
- medical
    + associated primary tumors (MPP)
        * medullary thyroid cancer (virutally 100% of cases)
        * pheos (50%, often bilateral pheos)
        * primary hyperparathyroidism (only in 20% of cases, and is usually fairly mild and may not produce symptoms)
    + other assocaited conditions
        * Hirschsprung disease (absence of ANS ganlgion cells == congenital megacolon)
        * cutaneous lichen amyloidosis
- treatment/ screening is similar to 2B (see below)


# Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B ()
- basics
    + AD disorder == MTC, pheos (no hyperparathyroidism), mucosal neuromas
    + patients also have a marfanoid body habitus
- medical
    + primary associated tumors (MMP + M)
        * MTC (virtually all patients, more aggressive than MEN2A and secretes calcitonin)
        * pheos (50%, usu develops after MTC)
        * mucosal neuromas (esp of the lips and tongue)/ intestinal ganglioneuromas
    + cx
        * deaths in MEN2B 50% @cx related to MTC
- clinical
    + presentation
        * sx of tumors/ endocrine syndromes
        * marfanoid body hapitus
- treat
    + surgical: surgical removal of MTC is not curative. surgical removal of the thyroid may be indicated @early identification @neonatal period, or as soon as the condition is diagnosed. 
- investigate
    + genetic subtyping
        * @suspicion/ Fhx == should have RET mutations determined == will risk stratify and prognosticate.
    + aim for prophylaxis, screening for pheos/ MTC. (according to risk assoc with exact mutation == start earlier/ later)
    + bloods
        * screen with serum calcitonin (released @MTC)
        * 24 jr plasma fractionated metanephrines (screening for pheos)
    + urine
        * 24 hr urine fractionated metanephrines (screening for pheos)

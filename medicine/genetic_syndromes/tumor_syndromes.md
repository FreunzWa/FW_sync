###### Neoplastic syndromes

# VHL Syndrome (Von Hippel Lindau disease)
- basics
    + heritable AD syndrome == ++benign/ malignant tumors.
- class
    + 1A: -=pheos, ++risk of other lesion
    + 1B: -=pheos/-=RCCs, ++risk @other lesion
    + 2A: ++pheos/ -=RCC
    + 2B: ++pheos/ ++RCC
    + 2C: ++pheos, NO hemangioblastoma/ RCC 
- pathophysiology
    + VHL associated tumors
        * hemangioblastoma (CNS: brain, retina, spine), clear cell RCCs, pheos, pancreatic cystadenomas, endolymphatic sac tumors of middle ear, epididymal/ broad ligament cystadenomas.  
        * also ++Renal cysts
        * ELSTs: %bilateral middle ear slow growing lesions == conductive hearing loss
- clinical
    + present
        * usu @26 years
        * sx depend on tumor type/ location/ size etc/ presence of mets etc.
        * ELSTs: conductive hearing loss %bilateral/ %tinnitus 
- treat
    + surveillance @known genotype == early detection/ -=mets.
    + screening protocol begins @birth annually for remainder of life.
    + RCC: nephron sparing surgery (partial nephrectomy/ Rfreq Ablation), esp for <3cm lesions == not radical nephrectomy @low metastatic potential
- investigate
    + genetic testing: detect mutation in VHL gene == referral to specialist centres. %difficult to detect @mosaicism @lymphocytes may not carry mutation (the cells which are tested)
    + prenatal testing (@parent affected) @amniocentesis

# Neurofibromatosis (NF)
    NF1 (most common)
    NF2
    Schwannomatosis

# Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)
- basics
    + AD disorder w/ full penetrance w/ variable expression @mosaicism. most common phakomatosis (neurocutaneous disorders)
    + aka von Recklinghausen disease
    + cutaneous neurofibromas, cafe-au-lait macules
- medical   
    + neurofibromin mutation NF1, == NF1 associated tumors
    + 50%inherited familial cases, otherwise de novo mutations
    + NF1 associated tumors - most common are the optic pathway gliomas.
        * other: rhabdomyosacroma, GIT stromal tumors, glomus, MPNSTs
- class
    + systemic vs. segmental (@mosaicism)
- clinical
    + presentation (in usual order of appearance)
        * 95% cafe-au-lait macules (flat pigmented congenital naevi). usu benign, but @>6 presnet == high risk of NF1. fade late in life.
        * axillary/ inguinal freckling, regions of skin apposition. appears @3-5 years.
        * lisch nodules (iris hamartomas) {95% <6 years old} 
        * cutaneous neurofibromas (peripheral nerve sheath tumors comprised of Schwann cells, fibroblasts) {nodular/ plexiform when matted}
        * NF1 associated tumors sx
    + %child delayed/ premature puberty @optic chiasm glioma == hypothalamic involvement
    + %scoliosis, osteoporosis, cognitive/ development abnormality
    + %++seizures
    + macrocephaly
    + HTN from childhood
- diagnosis
    + clinical + imaging 2 or more of:(ONG/OPG, >6 cafe au lait spots, >2 neurofibromas + 1 plexiform NF, distinctive osseous lesions, >2 lisch nodules, axillary freckling, Fhx - CAFESPOT)

###### Developmental syndrome

# Noonan syndrome
- basics
    + common AD condition (~1 in 1000 but some cases underdiagnosed @mild clinical presentation) assoc with short stature and CHD (usu pulmonic valve stenosis/ HCM). clinically/ genetically heterogenous. 
    + sometimes parents diagnosed @more severely affected child
- medical
    + Ras-MAPK pathway mutation
- clinical (variable)
    + rf
        * both sexes are affected the same
        * advanced parental age
    + presentation
        * unusual facial features (widely spaced eyes, low set ears - features most recognisable in childhood), short stature beginning in childhood
        * cryptorchidism
        * 50%pulmonic valve stenosis (murmur), >80% have any kind of cardiac involvement
        * 20%HCM
        * %delayed speech or motor milestones
        * %keratosis pilaris
        * %strabismus/ deafness
        * %lymphedema @disorded lymphatic developent
        * %giant cell tumors of the jaw (benign)
- rx
    + cardiac: (ASDs, pulmonics valve, )
- ix
    + ECG: shows left/ right axis deviation. 
    + genetic testing: 80% shows associated mutation, but there are 20% of patients with no identifiable mutation still determined to have NS (other genes?)

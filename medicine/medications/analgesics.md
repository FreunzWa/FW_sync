    Opioids
    

### Opioids
- general information
    + base chemical is morphine, extracted from papaver somniferum plant, which produces opium. synthetic opioids are derived from the morphine base. 
- mechanism
    + most act @mu opioid receptor in the CNS, upregulate descending pain inhibition, cough suppression @medullary centre. 
- indications
    + control of moderate-severe pain
    + chronic dyspnoea (ameliorates sensation of dyspnoea and tidal volume)
    + anxiety
    + in special cases used @opioid replacmeent @opioid dependence.

# Codeine
- considerations
    + not really used much @genetic polymorphism in metabolism genes == variable hepatic conversion, and %++conversion into ++morphine @ultra rapid metabolisers == acute overdose
    + especially contraindicated @young age <12 yrs old. 

# Fentanyl
- considerations
    + good @renal impairment @not renally cleared
    + 100x stronger than morphine

# Hydromorphone
# Methadone
- indications
    + opioid dependence, in methadone replacement therapy
- considerations
    + ++QT interval == risk of tachyarrhythmias
    + increased dose required @pregnancy @++metabolism
    + avoid/ moderate alcohol consumption. must be titrated to withdrawal symptoms/ opioid intoxication.
    + pt cannot operate machinery or drive @drowsiness.
- ses
    + standard opioids, drowsiness
    + rare (tachyarrthmias, TDP @prolonged QT interval, sudden cardiac death)
- brands
    + biodone forte (oral liquid)
- dose
    + 

# Morphine
- considerations
    + routes: IV, SC, oral liquid, PO
- brands
    + sevredol (tab), ordine (oral liquid), morphine hydrochloride (intrathecal), 
    + 12 hr controlled release
        * MS Contin, Momex, Oral liquid (MS Contin suspension)
    + 12/24 hr controlled release 
        * Kapanol (cap)
    + 24 hr controlled release
        * MS Mono 

# Oxycodone
- mechanism
- indications
    + moderate-severe pain
- considerations
    + reduce dose @renal impairment w/ GFR <30.
    + avoid in hepatic impairment.-



# Pethidine
# Tapentadol
# Tramadol

# Burprenorphine
- mechanism
    + unlike almost all other opioids acts as a partial opioid receptor agonist. 
- indications
    + opioid dependence, opioid withdrawal
    + %used for chronic pain control
- ses
    + cmomon(constipation, dyspepsia, hypotension, nausea and vomiting)
    + rare (bradycaria, respiratory depression, anaphylaxis, pruritis)
- considerations
    + @already on another opioid, bup will reduce analgesic effect @partial agonist.
    + do not drink alcohol or drive whilst on buprenorphinee
    + increased potency @hepatic impairment 
- brands
    + subuxone, subutex




### Side effects caused by opioids

# Constipation
- mx
    + in the GI tract, ++opioid delta receptors in the myenteric and submucosal plexus == ++adenylate cyclase == calcium channel inhibition == -= Nt release == GI paresis.

###### Antimuscarinics (anticholinergics)

# General physiological effects of antimuscarinics @antagonism of M1,2,3,4,5 receptors.
- anti-DUMBBELS
    + constipation
    + urinary retention
    + mydriasis (pupillary dilation)
    + dry airways
    + tachycardia
    + anti-emetic
    + decreased lacrimation (dry eyes)
    + decreased salivation (dry throat and mouth)
    + bronchodilation

# Glycopyrrolate
- mx
- indications
    + anaesthesia (used before surgery @reduce slaivary/ tracheobronchial secretions, also used together with neostigmine to reverse some of neostigmine pro-muscarinic effects like bradycardia)
    + death rattle (@terminal patients == -=gag reflex, dysphagia == can use to reduce secretions, has not found that this helps much, but shown to comfort family)
    + inhaled form for COPD == bronchodilation
- SEs
    + common(dry throat/ mouth, throat irritation)
    + rare(blurred vision/ hypersensitivity to light, urinary retention, constipation, acute angle cllosure crisis, palpitations/ tachycardia/ allergies)
- considerations
    + care taken for Renal impairment @++chance of anticholingergic SEs
    + care in combining @other anti-muscarinics.
- brands
    + Ultibro (INH), Robinul (inj)
- dosage


# In the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome
- basics
    + may be @originally obstructive cause == bladder irritation. then can potentially be complicated by overflow incontinence/ OAB incontinence
- examples
    + tolteridone, oxybutynin, darifenacin, solifenacin, fesoterodine, trospium
- ses
    + standard anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, tachycardia, blurred vision @lack of ciliary accomodation, drowsiness, constipation)

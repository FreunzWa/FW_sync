###### Antipsychotics
    Typical/ Traditional
        High potency (++EPSE, less musc SEs)
            Haloperidol, Fluphenazine, Droperidol
        Low potency
            Chlorpromazine (less EPSEs, more musc SEs)
    Atypical
        newer generation, claimed to produce fewer EPSE
        more likely to cause weight gain and T2DM



### Typical antipsychotics


# olanzapine
- mechanism
    + 5HT2A full agonist, central D2 antagonist, esp @limbic system. (atypical antipsychotic)
- indications
    + BPAD w/ Li/ valproate
    + Schizophrenia and related spectrum of psychoses
- SEs
    + metabolic effects
    + common {hyperglycaemia, Drug-induced T2DM, peripheral edema, agittation, hypotension + othrostatic hypotension, tachy, blurred vision, constipation, NV, weight gain esp @young pt, sexual adverse effects, dry mouth}
    + uncommon {EPSE, elevation of Liver ATs}
    + rare {VTE, rhabdomyolysis, hepatic failure, SJS, SIADH, hyperthermia, hypothermia, NMS, pancytopaenia, stroke, dysarthria, dysphagia, resp depression, QT prolongation}
- considerations
    + allergies, tobacco induces ++clearance of olanzapine
    + diabetes: %worsen hyperglycaemia
    + @hyperthyroidism: ++risk of acute dystonia
    + @shock: ++hypotension/ worsening of end organ failure
    + PD: ==aggravate PD (use other antipsychotic eg clozapine, quetiapine)
    + hepatic failure == dose reduction, @anaesthesia reduce dose @++risk of hypotension
- brands
    + zyprexa/ zypine, pryzex, Zyprexa Zydis, Zyprexa Relprevv (long acting inj.)
- dosing
    + ongoing schizophrenia
        * start PO 5-10mg, then increase daily dose by 2.5-5mg each week @indicated up to max of 20mg. @risk of falls/ orthostatic hypotension == start at 5
    + agitation/ acute mania in BPAD
        * Short acting IM 5-10mg. followed w/ further doses of 10mg at 2 and 6 hrs after dose. max 30mg for 24 hrs.
    + BPAD
        * PO 5-20mg od
    + @old, renal, hepatic impairment
        * start with 5mg daily and increase accordingly, watching for ADR/ SE

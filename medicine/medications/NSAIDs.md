###### NSAIDs
----------------------------------------------------

antipyretics, anti-inflammatories, analgesics.

---------------------------------------------------
- General COX inhibition == -=prostaglandin synthesis. PGs cause pyrexia and local inflammation. Thus reduces cardinal features of inflammation and reduces fever. 
- Adverse effects of COX inhibition
    + COX-1 inhibition == impaired gastric cytoprotection, causes antiplatelet effects. 
    + COX-2 inhibition == anti-inflammatory and analgesic pain
    + Either COX-1/COX-2 == reduction in GFR and fluid retention. 
- COX-1 usually == ++production of PGE2 == -=gastric acid secretion. Thus @inhibition == ++gastric acid production == ++ulcers and +incidence of Upper GI bleeds.
- indications
    + pain @inflammatory arthropathies (OA, RA, gout, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis)
    + pain @tissue inflammation, migraine, postoperative pain.
    + pyrexia 
- considerations
    + precaution
        * withhold @dehydration eg@vomiting/diarrhoea: @-=renal function/ AKI. @PGI2 inhibition == -=renal flow. 
        * asthma: may increase risk of bronchospasm
        * coagulation disorders: may increase risk of bleeding @antiplatelet effect (TXA2 inhibition)
        * bruising
        * cardiovascular disease @%+=risk of MI
        * %poorly tolerated in elderly
    + counselling
        * dont take @dehyrdated
        * @see black stool/ dark coffee colour vomit/ SOA/ dyspnoea stop taking medication and present 
    + CI
        * @severe renal impairment GFR <30
        * severe hepatic impairment
    + pharma
        * should be effective @chronic pain within 3 weeks. if not effective then try different NSAID. 60% effective on first try.
- ses/ ADRs
    + hypersensitivity: angioedema/ asthma
    + common: dyspepsia, GI ulceration/ bleeding, raised ALTs (esp diclofenac), diarrhoea, headache. 
    + rare: interstitial nephritis, MI, stroke, SJS, TEN, hepatitis, angioedema/asthma


# Classes
-----------------------------------------------------------
    Selective (COX-2 selective)
    Non-selective


# COX-2 selective
- basics
    + originally conceived @thought that COX-1 inhibition was always bad due to gastric side effects (like ++risk of gastric bleeding @decreased cytoprotection), but selective COX-2 == ++risk of MI or other cardiac events. 
    + actually also associated with adverse GI effects as well..
- examples
    + Celecoxib (Celebrex)
    + Etiricoxib
    + Meloxicam
    + Parecoxib
- considerations
    + CI @heart failure/ angina/ peripheral arterial disease/ cerebrovascular disease @+=MI risk.
    + CI @severe hepatic impairment (Charles C)

# Non-selective
- examples
    + Diclofenac
    + Ipuprofen
    + Indometacin
    + Ketoprofen
    + Ketorolac
    + Mefenamic acid
    + Naproxen
    + Piroxicam
    + Sulindac
    + Aspirin


### Specific medications

# Selective COX-2 inhibitors
-----------------------------------------
# Celecoxib
- mx
    + COX-2 selective inhibitor == antipyretic/ antiinflammatory. 
- dose
    + risk of CV events is dose related
    + anklosing spondylitis: PO up to 200mg
    + RA: up to 100mg, may be increased to 200mg for short periods @flare
    + period pain/ postop pain: PO 400mg first day, 200 mg daily from then on, max 5 days treatment
- brands
    + celaxib, Celebrex, Celexi

# Diclofenac
- mx
    + COX-2 selective inhibitor == antipyretic/ antiinflammatory. 
- considerations
    + MI/ cardiovascular disease risk is the highest with Diclofenac out of all NSAIDs




# Non-selective NSAIDs
-----------------------------------------
# Naproxen
- mx
- indications
- ses
- considerations
    + MI/Cardiovascular risk lowest with Naproxen out of all NSAIDs

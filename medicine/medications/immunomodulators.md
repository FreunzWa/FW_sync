### DMARDs (disese modifying anti-rheumatic drug)
-----------------------------------------------------------

# Hydroxychloroquine

    + rare: hyperpigmentation, aplastic anaeamia, seizures, severe hypoglycaemia, cardiac conduction disordersz
- considerations
    + carefuly with driving/ heavy machinery @commonly affects vision, dizziness. 
- brands
    + Plaquenil, Hequinel
- dosage
    + RA: 400-600 mg daily 1-3 months then continue @minimum effective dose. up to 800 mg for SLE.

# Methotrexate (immunomodulatory)
- mx
    + suppresses inflammation, perhaps @folic acid antagonist but perhaps another mechanism
- indications
    + Rheumatoid arthritis
    + Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
    + also an antineoplastic
    + severe disabling psoriasis, Chron's disease
- ses
    + common: GI sx (NVD), mouther ulceration, cytopaenias, malaise, reversible alopecia, ATs, photosensitivity
    + rare: SJS/ TEN, PF
    + may cause reactivation of hepB/C or activation of TB
- considerations
    + Hepatotoxic (monitor ATs), pulmonotoxic (PF), BM toxicity (monitor FBE). usu monitor once /2-4 weeks initially.
    + CI @Bone Marrow disease (@will worsen), chronic infection/ or repeated infection (eg untreated HepB/C, untreated TB)
    + CI @GFR <10. Reduced dose @impaired GFR
    + PregX
    + combine with folic acid == -=ulceration/ NVD
    + limit alcohol consumption @alcohol == ++GI sx
- brand
    + Trexject, Methoblastin
- dose
    + 1/ week same day. max25-30mg. SC/IM/PO


# Sulfasalazine
- mx
    + 90% reaches the colon == metabolised by bacteria into sulfapyridine and mesasalazine (5-ASA). Sulfapyridine is then further absorbed == systemic anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Mesalazine remains in colon == local anti-inflammatory effectsw
- indications
    + rheumatoid arthritis
    + juvenile idiopathic arthritis
    + %used @IBD
- ses
    + nausea/ vomiting/ abdominal pain/ anorexia/ headache/ somnolence
    + rare (depression in young males, oligospeermia, thrombocytopaenia, haemolytic anaemia @G6PD  deficiency, skin/ urine orange discoloration)\
    + potential cause of acute pancreatitis
- copnsdierations
    + serum levels of sulfapyridine should be measured every 3 months. more frequently @strt (@>50 mg/L == side effects)
- brands
    + salazopyrin
    + pyralin
- dosage
    + RA: 500mg daily initially, increase daily dose by 500mg daily up to maximum of 3g daily. use divided doses @this level. 

# Methotrexate (MTX)
- notes
    + DMARD and chemotherapy agent, prev known as 
- mx
    + 

### Calcineurin inhibitors
----------------------------------------------------------------

# Ciclosporin
- mx
    + inhibition of T cells @inhjibition of calcineurin mediated inflammatory pathway transcription.  (prevents NF-AT ffunction == -=IL2 and other mediator release)
- indications
    + severe RA @unresponsive to other immunomodulators
    + Chrons disease, psoriasis, nephrotic syndrome
    + Solid organ transplant - prevent acute rejection
    + other autoimmune diseases (eg Behcet's, lupus nephritis, uveitis)
- ses
    + common(nephrotoxic, HTN, hyperchlesterollaemia, raised ATs, hyperkalaemia, hyperglycaemia)
    + rare (HUS, myopathy)
- considerations
    + CI @uncontrolled HTN, malignancy, chronic infection, renal impairment @renally cleared
    + may do concetntratrion moniroting @transplant pts, not usu autoimmune diseaes. 
- brands
    + Neoral (10,25,40,100 mg)
- dosage
    + 3 mg/kg daily divided for 6-12 weeks. increase up to maximum of 4 mg/kgs. 

# Tacrolimus
- mx
    + block calcineurin == -=pro-inflammatory gene transcription in activated T cells == -=IL2 secretion. 
- ix
    + prevention of trasplant rejection
- ses
    + may prolong QT interval == TDP tachyarrhythmias
    + common (alopecia)
    + rare (hirsutism, gingival hyperplasia, ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, TDP, pure red cell aplasia)
- considerations
    + @children require increased dose @++clearance
    + CI @chronic infection/ infection risk
- brands
    + Advagraf, Prograf, Tacrograf, Pacrolim
- dosage
    + IV dose is 1/3 of oral dose
    + Prevention of transplant rejection: 75-300 mcg/kg daily.


### Antimetabolites
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Azathioprine
- mx
    + impairs bone marrow immune cell production (affects other lineages)
    + purine antimetabolite, metabolised to form thioguanine nucleotides which interfere with purine == DNA synthesis == -=lymphocyte function and immune reposnse
- ix
    + prevent transplant rejection
    + severe RA
    + IBD
    + autoimmune hepatitis
    + SLE
    + pemphigus
- ses
    + common(dose related myelosuppression with comb of pancytopaenia, infx, alopecia, diarrhoea, anorexia, NV) 
    + rare(hepatitis, SJS, TEN, pancreatitis, bone marrow failure esp @combination with drugs that impair elimination of azathioprine) 
- considerations
    + interact with Febuxostat and allopurinol (the gout meds, which cause buildup of azathioprine == severe bone marrow toxicity)
    + lowered dose @hepatic/ renal impairment. 
    + tell patient to monitor for bleeding, bruising, infection, severe fatigue
    + tell patient to avoid excessive sun epxosure and wear ++sunscreen @++skin cancer risk
- brands
    + imuran, imazan, thioprine
- dosages
    + reqruies specialist, but usu oral 1-3mgkg divided.

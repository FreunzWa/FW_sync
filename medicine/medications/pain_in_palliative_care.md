###### Pain in palliative care
Su 35, drummer, single, non smoker, drinks occasionally, hep c 2nd to IV use as a teenager, depressed (paroxetine), breast R) carcinoma w/ mastectomy and curative, tamoxifen, 6 monthly check ups, clear most recent scan.

pain in r chest wall since the surgery.
- numbness, 18 months post surge, increasing, definite pain rather than discomfort. triggered @movement, burning. shooting pain. 
- chronic post surgical pain, likely neuropathic pain (pain @lesion affecting somatosensory system, from peripheral to higher centres)
- post surgical neuropathic pain not entirely uncommon, and varies depending on types (eg amputation up to 80%, hernia 5-35%, c-section 15%, )

treated with TCA, escalated, but no improvement. Gabapentin added 300mg with minor improvement. after weeks, still high level of pain, unable to play the drums. tramadol (vomiting), opioid added (but concern that there will be dependence re-emergence @past exposure).started on oxycontin 5mg bd (start low, go slow despite habitus etc.). this@some people more SN than others.gradually increased to 20mg. very good results, bac to drumming.
3 months later, please review this patient, on 40mg of oxycontin twice daily. builing up a tolerance. started using endone, which has also been ineffective. 
- is it the same pain? its a new pain, more electric shocks and radiates to the bacl. new pain: suggest more imaging (CXRAY and thoracic spine xrya but need to lomse 40% of bone, NAD, breast screen clear 5 months ago). MRI. 
- bone scan: will clearly show any mets, and mets elsewhere. MRI shows mets to bone. throughout the entire body, liver mets as well. 
- likely T4 nerve root pain. 
- blood tests: LFTs, coags. Ca2+ , magnesium. 
- other treatments for her pain:
    + treatthe underlying cancer w/ radiation (in pallcare can use lower doses @even small reduction in tumor size may control pain well), psychotherapy (CBT), music therapy, physioterhapy, optimising other medical issues, address financial issues. 
    + bisphosphonates, treatment of boney pain, reduces incidence of pain.
    + NSAIDs (GI bleeding, kidney imparimetn, edema, AMI)
- Su gets palliative chemotherpay and radiotherapy, returns in 5 weeks with excrutiating pain in right arm. 
- comes in with pathological fracture, acute pain relief. 

# Post surgical pain
- 25-50% of individuals post mastectomy experience some degree of neuropathic pain.
- rf
    + poorly treated anxiety and depression
    + poorly treated pain prior to surgery 
    + genetic predispositions
    + repeat surgeries
    + surgery assoc with post-operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy
    + poor surgical technique
    + females, younger people

# Treatments for post-surgical pain
- TCAs (amytriptyline): not used for depression any more. causes drowsiness (actually good @easier to sleep). 
-  







# Serotonin syndrome
- usu only @multiple medications, or @MAOi. SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, dexamphetamine, ecstasy @OD, antihistamines, methodone, fentanyl.
- Autonomic hyperactivity
    + sialhorea
- neurmosulcuar
    + pyramidal regitiy, 
mental status
- mania/ delirium


# Addiction
- primary chronic neurobiological in which cmopulsive use of a substance that causes harm to user and continues use of substance despite such harm. 
- rf for addiction
    + past history of addiction
    + addictive personality
    + low SE status (debateable)
    + younger (16-45)
    + history of pre-adolescent sexual abuse
    + various psychiatric disorders (BPD, BPAD, )
    + family history of addiction (drug abuse, including cigarettes)

# Opioids
- Targin
    + naloxone + oxycodone
    + @hepatic impairmetn, then naloxone spillso ver and actually get no therapeutic benefit. so targin not to be used in moderate-severe liver disease. 
    + esp in pall care patients, constipation usu multifactorial so need aperient anyway so targin not used very much
- Fentanyl 
    + intranasal (very quick acting opiate, esp used @paraemedics) 
    + Refentanyl, Sufentanyl etc. are even faster thna fentanyl, and very short duration of action as well.
    + can be used @dialysis
- Methadone
    + used for methadone subtitution therapy, best opioid replacement drug. blocks the euphoric effects of heorin, relieves user of desire to seek heroin. 
    + effective in neuropathic pain
    + typically administered orally. 
    + cytochrome metabolism so has more drug-drug interactions. 
    + anti-inflammatory effect
    + used bd, not a short acting drug. 
- Codeine
    + converted into morphine. about 20% lack the enzyme that converts it. <5% are ultra-metabolres, but high ~30% of arabic populations are ultrametabolisers. then they overdose, esp on dental table/ breastfeeding
    + very unreliable, shouldnt use and very constipating.
    + panadeine-forte: paracetamol + codeine
- Buprenorphine
    + also used in opioid replacemnt therapy as a subsitute for methadone
    + patches last 1 week for chronic pain, oral form as a short acting opioid
    + not affected by renal function, can be used @dialysis
    + dose varialble
- hydromorphone
    + 5-10x more potency than morphine. risk of OD high.
    + dont have small doses, so cant use small amounts. so difficult to use when first initiaiting, thus usu @first line fails. 
- tapentadol
    + lower rates of dependence
    + non pure opioid
    + difficult to convert from tapentadol to another opioid
- morphine
    + baseline opioid, measure other opioids by doing conversions to morphine
    + IV, SC, PO, epidural, inhaled, topically
    + pure mu opioid antagonist
    + cheap in comparison to all other opiatess
- pethadine
    + good for child birth, short acting
    + may cause serotonin syndrome, convulsions





* Codeine no longer on the PBS

penfrane


intrathecal pump, used @catheter end right on the end of the nerves which are involved to numb the nerves involved. or hwne the dose of opiate is so high that you cannot increase the dose (too may adverse effects). can also add pioids, local anaesthetic.

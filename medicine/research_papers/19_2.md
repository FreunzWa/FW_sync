# Types of trials (terms used to describe clinical trials)
- pragmatic clinical trial
    + focus on showing real world correlations, rather than attempting to show causation by enforcing very strict inclusion/ exclusion criteria.
- individually randomised trial 
    + participants in the study receive at least some treatment in groups/ through a common change agent (esp used @surgical trials, the surgeon operates on multiple participants)

        * less coughing
        * less phlegm
        * less nausea
        * more throat/ mouth irritation

- Russll Standard for smoking abstinence - used in clinical trials
- carbon monoxide validation is used to determine if a patient has been smoking recently, as smoking elevates it.

###### Pancreatitis

# Classification
    Acute pancreatitis
        Intestitial edematous pancreatitis
        Necrotizing pancreatitis (5-10%)
            Infected pancreatic necrosis
    Chronic pancreatitis



# Acute pancreatitis
- basics
- medical
    + etiologies (I GET SMASHED)
        * idiopathic
        * gallstones 
        * alcoholic pancreatitis
        * trauma
        * steroids
        * mumps + other viruses (EBV, CMV, HIV)
        * Autoimmune diseases (SLE, PAN, pregnancy)
        * Stings and envenomations
        * Hypercalcemia, Hypertriglyceridaemia, Hypothermia, Hypotension (ishcaemic pancreatitis)
        * ERCP, emboli
        *  Drugs (SAND + MR VET)
- medical
    + cx
        * organ failure/ septic shock @systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
-  presentation
    +  may have antecedent history of biliary colic 
    +  acute onset epigastric pain %rad to back, %RUQ (%%LUQ)
    +  pain maximal at 10 minutes
    +  @hereditary / alcohol == more diffuse, less abrupt onset of pain
    +  %partially relieved @sitting up/ bending forward
    +  90%N/V persisting for hours
    +  %dyspnoea @diaphragmatic irritation (esp @severe pancreatitis)
    +  %hypoactive bowel obstruction @inflammation == ileus
    +  @gallstone %also assoc with obstructive jaundice
    +  %%%ecchymotic discoloration in periumbilical/ flank (Cullens/ Grey Turner)
    +  %panniculitis
    +  non specific features of inflammation (eg fever and chills)
    +  %features of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (steatorrhea)
-  diagnosis
    +  2 of 3 criteria:
        *  acute onset peristent severe epigastric pain %radiating to the back
        *  elevation of lipase/amylase >3x normal
        *  CT/MRI w/ characteristic findings (see below)
- investigations
    + bloods
        * serum lipase (x3), elevated 24 hrs after attack. 
        * serum amylase (less SN/SP), @%less production of parenchymal amylase == elevations not 3x normal, esp seen in alcohol mediated pancreatitis
        * CRP
    + imaging
        * AXR/CXR
            - @mild == NAD
            - @moderate-severe == localised ileus of small intestine (sentinel loop), colon cutoff sign (@severe pancreatitis == inflammation == functional spasm of the descending colon)
        * USS
            - diffusely enlarged/ hypoechoic, %visualise gallstones
            - peripancreatic fluid
        * CT+C 
            - peripancreatic fat stranding
            - %areas of hypointensity (lack of contrast enhancement) suggestive of necrosis @severe
            - %visulise CBD stone
            - %pancreatis mass in underliyn gpancreatic cancer (which may be @underlying chronic pancreatits == cancer and acute pancreatitis)
        * MRI
            - better SN/SP for early acute pancreatitis

# Stomach physiology
- cell types and roles
    + Parietal cells secrete
        * HCl (produces acidic contents of stomach to allow pepsinogen activation)
        * Intrinsic Factor (Binds VitB12 to allow absorption)
    + chief cells secrete
        * pepsinogen (activated acidic contents of stomach created by parietal cells)
        * chymosin (aka rennin, it coagulates milk in the stomach)
- hormones at play
    + PGE2 (stimulates mucous production, reduces acid secretion)
        * non selective (and also COX-2 selective to an extent) reduce this == acidification == ++ulcers/risk of perforation.
    + Histamine (binds H2 receptors to indirectly increase gastric acid production)

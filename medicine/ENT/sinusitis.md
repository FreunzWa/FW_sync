###### Nasal sinus conditions

minitrephine

phantosmia - no odorants present, pt smells something (usu horrible, faecal smell, disabling)
nasal polyps 99%benign

# ENT investigations
- otoscopy with headlight and magnification
- plain film not used @inferior to CT
- MRI if malignancy is suspected.
- swab - needs to be taken of the pus, so really requires endocscope, can guide treatment.

# Anatomy
- superior/ middlie/ inferior terbinates, dividing the superior/middle and inferior meatus
    + nasolacrimal duct into the inferior meatus
- sinuses  (4 on each side)
    + sphenoid sinus (deep in the skull)
    + maxillary sinus
    + ethmoid (between the eyes)
    + frontal sinus
- OMC (osteomeatal complex)
- @blockage of meatus == accumulation and blockage/ sinusitis
- pain of sinusitis
    + frontal - forehead pain
    + maxillary sinus - cheek dental pain
    + ehtmoid sinus  -pain btewen eyes
    + spheoid sinus - vertex pain

# Sinusitis (correct term actually rhinosinusitis)
- basics
    + inflamm response involving the mucous membranes of hte nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses
    + CRS - sx present for at least 12 weeks.
- medical
    + categories
        * acute (<4 weeks)
        * chronic (>12 weeks)
    + etiology
        * viral URTI (1-2% wil develop sinusitis)
        * bacterial infections (%after initial viral infection)
            - esp strep pneumo, h influenzae, moraxella, staph aureus
    + complications
        * pre-septal inflammation, orbital cellulitis, orbital abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis. meningitis, brain abscess, CST, mucocele formation 
- clinical
    + rf
        * mucociliary disorders eg CF
        * nasal polyps
    + presentation
        * facial pressure
        * pain, congstion, fullness
        * nasal obstruction, post nasal drip/ discharge
        * hyposmia, anosmis, headaches, halitosis, fatigue, dental pain
        * %sinus pain
- differnetials
    + headcaches: minimal other symptoms to suggest CRS. CT scan normal. 
    + fungal sinusitis: double densities on CT scan within the involved sinus
    + Tumor: unilateral sx or signs/ blood/ paraesthesia/ numbness over cheeks. 
- treat
    + @biofilm formation == Abx are ineffective.
    + Nasal saline douching
    + Topical steroids (steroid sprays). delay onset in action. (shrink the surrounding tissue)
    + nasal decogestants no longer used @rebound hypervascularity.
    + Oral Abx (macrolides, @also have an anti-inflammatory effect - usu up to 21 days.
    + Nasal irrigation
    + surgical:
        * @failed medical treatment, placement of minimally invasive
- investigate
    + CT scan
        * @unsure of the diagnosis, not repsonsing to medical treatment, or when surgery is planned.
        * plain film not used. 
    + allergen testing (skin prick or blood test), immunology assessment (eg @hx of unusual infections/ pneumonia)

# Allergic rhinitis
- investigate
    + determine allergen
- treat
    + environmental modification, de-sensitisation through allergist

# Nasal polyps
- treat
    + short course of prednisolone, for 5 days

# Fungal sinusitis
- medical
    + types
        * fungal ball
            - most common, 1 sinus affected
        * allergic fungal sinusitis
            - polyps present, usu unilateral. surgery and oral steroids
        * acute invasive
            - 50-80% mortality. requires surgery.


# Trauma/ fractured nose
- within 3 week window otherwise becomes set

# Epistaxis
- anterior more common, especially little's area in the anterior septum
- silver nitrate for nasal cauterisation.
- surgical intervention @persistent bleeding after admission

# Rhinosinusitis
- basics
    + prev distinguished between rhinitis and sinusitis but similar rocess, often co-incident. 
- medical
    + etiology
        * acute viral rhinosinusitis: duration of sx <10 days
        * acute post viral rhinosinusitis: persisten worsening following acute infeciton. 
        * mucociliary dysfunction (eg in CF), primary ciliary dyskinesia (usu present with resp sx), IgA deficiencies (until IgG develops)
- clinical
    + rf
        * day care, adenoidal nasal obstruction, swimming in chlorinated swimming pools, passive smoking, urbam living, winter, 6-8 years old. GERD (may reflux into nasopharynx)
    + presentation
        * cough, rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction, mouth breathing, middle ear sx.
        * nasal mucosa color, postnasal discharge  
- rx
    + topical corticosteroids (reduce nasal discharge and cough). topical decogenstants not very effective. 
        

# Allergic rhinitis
- basics
    + may develop nasal crease @chronic pressing up on nose
- rx
    + allergen avoidance (cover mattress, wash linen in hot water, vaccuum weekly)
    + intranasal steroids spray
- ix
    + allergy testing (RAST not as good as SPT), cilial function at the hcildrens hospital 
    + montelukast may be effective
    + surgery @severe and recurrent. 

adenoids - can cause nasal obstruction, rhinosinusitis, OSA
- adenoidectomy: may improve symptoms in may childdren, esp @choric rhinosinusitis

# choanal atresia
- no opening at the back of the nose (must be operated on @babies do not breathe through the mouth, only thoguh nose)



# Tonsillitis
- medical
    + etiology
        * viral: EBV
        * bacterial: h influenzae, moraxella, GAS (much more common @young)
    + complications
        * acute rheumatic fever (@strep throat)/ post streptococcal GN
- clinical
    + presentation
        * sore throat, fever, exudate on tonsis, tender cervical lymphadenopathy
- rx
    + usually dont reuqire Abx (phenoxymethylpenicillin or IM benzylpenicillin), for 10 days, GAS is usually susceptible. indicated for pt with sclarlet fever, or high rates of rheuatic fever. 

# Indications for tonsillectomy
- OSA (the overwhelming most common indication)
- Recurrent tonsillitis
    + more than 6 episodes in the past year. or 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years, 5 episodes per year in past 2 years. 
- Recurrent peritonsillar abscess (quinsy)
- query Malignancy (lymphoma - esp post liver trasnplant lymphoproliferative disease, SCC)

# Tonsillectomy
- NSAIDs increase risk of a bleed being a major bleed in the postoperative period, so not used. 

# OSA
- basics
    + airway obstruction causing temporary apnoea whilst sleeping. usu with snoring and noisy breathing (@severe may not cause noise). 
    + ++resp effort, restless, frequent waking w/ sleep fragmentation.
- medical
    + etiology
        * cerebral palsy, neurmosucular disorder. 
        * NM diseases (CP, creuzon and apert syndrome)
        * craniofacial anatomical factors (retrognathia)
        * adenoid/ tonsils.
        * obesity (mild lymphoid hyperplasia)
- clinical
    + presentation
        * may cause hyperactivity in children.
        * failure to thrive (@GH deficiency which is usu produced during REM sleep)
- ix
    + polysomnography
    + overnight oximetry (easy to implemet, only informs @hypoxiam which is only %present.)
- rx
    + %@watchful waiting until end of winter == improvement of symptoms
    + surgery curative @85%
    + CPAP
    + intranasal steroids and %montelukast

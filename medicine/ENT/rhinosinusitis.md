###### Nasal sinus conditions

phantosmia - no odorants present, pt smells something (usu horrible, faecal smell, disabling)
nasal polyps 99%benign

# ENT investigations
- otoscopy with headlight and magnification
- plain film not used @inferior to CT
- MRI if malignancy is suspected.
- swab - needs to be taken of the pus, so really requires endocscope, can guide treatment.

# Anatomy
- superior/ middlie/ inferior terbinates, dividing the superior/middle and inferior meatus
    + nasolacrimal duct into the inferior meatus
- sinuses  (4 on each side)
    + sphenoid sinus (deep in the skull)
    + maxillary sinus
    + ethmoid (between the eyes)
    + frontal sinus
- OMC (osteomeatal complex)
- @blockage of meatus == accumulation and blockage/ sinusitis
- pain of sinusitis
    + frontal - forehead pain
    + maxillary sinus - cheek dental pain
    + ehtmoid sinus  -pain btewen eyes
    + spheoid sinus - vertex pain

# Sinusitis (correct term actually rhinosinusitis)
- basics
    + symptomatic inflamm involving the mucous membranes of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses
    + term of rhinosinusitis is preferred @the inflammation ++%occurs with inflammation of the nasal mucosa
- medical
    + categories
        * ARS (<4 weeks) - acute 
        * CRS (>12 weeks) - chronic
    + etiology
        * ++@viral URTI
            - 1-2% of viral URTIs == ARS
        * 2%@bacterial infections (++%after initial viral infection) {ABRS}
            - esp strep pneumo, h influenzae, moraxella, staph aureus
        }   
    + natural history
        * AVRS: self resolving within 7-10 days.
        * ABRS: %self limited, but higher risk of CRS/ collection/ asbcess formation
    + complications
        * pre-septal inflammation, orbital cellulitis, orbital abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis. meningitis, brain abscess, CST, mucocele formation 
- clinical
    + rf
        * mucociliary disorders eg CF
        * nasal polyps
    + presentation
        * facial pressure
        * pain, congstion, fullness
        * nasal obstruction, post nasal drip/ discharge
        * hyposmia, anosmis, headaches, halitosis, fatigue, dental pain
        * %sinus pain
- differnetials
    + headcaches: minimal other symptoms to suggest CRS. CT scan normal. 
    + fungal sinusitis: double densities on CT scan within the involved sinus
    + Tumor: unilateral sx or signs/ blood/ paraesthesia/ numbness over cheeks. 
- treat
    + @biofilm formation == Abx are ineffective.
    + Nasal saline douching
    + Topical steroids (steroid sprays). delay onset in action. (shrink the surrounding tissue)
    + nasal decogestants no longer used @rebound hypervascularity.
    + Oral Abx (macrolides, @also have an anti-inflammatory effect - usu up to 21 days.
    + Nasal irrigation
    + surgical:
        * @failed medical treatment, placement of minimally invasive
- investigate
    + CT scan
        * @unsure of the diagnosis, not repsonsing to medical treatment, or when surgery is planned.
        * plain film not used. 
    + allergen testing (skin prick or blood test), immunology assessment (eg @hx of unusual infections/ pneumonia)

# Acute viral rhinosinusitis (AVRS)
- basics
    + distinguish from ABRS, @does not improve within 10 days == more likely to have ABRS (thus should be managed as ABRS)
    + treatment is supportive @no treatments exist to hasten clinical course.
- medical
    + natural history
        * usu self resolving
        * may not resolve <10 days, but should improve within this time. 
- clinical
- treatment
    + pharmacological symptom relief
        * fever/ systemic features - antipyretic/ analgesia (NSAIDs/ paracetamol)
        * intranasal glucocorticoids @obstruction (nasonex spray - mometasone liquid)
        * saline irrigation for obstruction

# Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS)
- basics
- treatment
    + Abx algorithm
        * Pen allergy
            - Ceph allergy
                + Doxycycline
                + 3rd generation cephalosporin
            - No ceph allergy
                + Doxycycline
        * No Pen allergy
            - Severe? (eg poor outcome predicted or RF for resistant strain)
                + High dose Augmentin extended release
            - Mild-moderate
                + Amoxicillin/ Augmentin
    + Abx should be given and the patient must respond or else confirmation of the diagnosis should be sought.




-------------------------------------------------

# Allergic rhinitis
- investigate
    + determine allergen
- treat
    + environmental modification, de-sensitisation through allergist
    + intranasal GCs (mometasone)

# Nasal polyps
- treat
    + short course of prednisolone, for 5 days

# Fungal sinusitis
- medical
    + types
        * fungal ball
            - most common, 1 sinus affected
        * allergic fungal sinusitis
            - polyps present, usu unilateral. surgery and oral steroids
        * acute invasive
            - 50-80% mortality. requires surgery.


# Trauma/ fractured nose
- within 3 week window otherwise becomes set

# Epistaxis
- anterior more common, especially little's area in the anterior septum
- silver nitrate for nasal cauterisation.
- surgical intervention @persistent bleeding after admission

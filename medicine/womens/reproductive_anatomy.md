###### Reproductive anatomy

#### Normal anatomy
    External genitalia
# External genitalia (vulva)
- mons pubis
    + fibrofatty cushion anterior and superior to the symphysis pubis. covered @hair. 
- labia majora
    + hair covered fibrofatty folds extend from mons pubis to the perineum. homologous with male scrotum. covered @sweat and sebaceous glands. 
- labia minora
    + smaller, enclosed within majora. devoid of hair, %sweat glands. vascular rich, ++nerve endings. superior enclose the clitoris.
    + inferiorly they merge to form teh vaginal fourchette (posterior ring)
- clitoris
    + male penis homologue, has vascular plexus arranged in central corpus with 2 crura. 1.5-2 cm in length. terminal 0.5 cm is the glans. 
    + minora enclose clit above (the prepuce), and the frenulum below. 
- vestibule (the floor)
    + comprises the area enclosed @labia minor 
    + the urethra and vagina open into it
- urethral meatus
    + 1-1.5 cm below the clitoris. usu covered @minora folds
- paraurethral duct (Skene's duct)
    + aka paraurethral gland - open just below and lateral to teh urethra
    + homologous to the male prostate gland. lubricate the urethral opening, thought to be antimicrobial
- posterior fourchette
    + the posterior/ inferior part where the minora and majora meet
- vaginal orifice
    + opens into lower part of the vestibule. @before pub == closed @hymenal membrane.
- Bartholin's ducts/ glands: open into the vestibule on posterolateral aspect. 5 and 7 oclock positions. responsible for lubrication during sexual intercousre. 
- perineum
    + vaginal fourchette (meeting of the minor and majora) anteriorly and the anus posteiorrly. 
    + deep is the perineal body. 
    + the perineum is teh area incised @

# Internal genitalia
[posterior fornix; corresponds to deepest part of the posterior vaginal wall, part that slips posterior to cervix-+]
- vagina
    + 8-12 cm in length, links vestibule to uterus. 
    + ++distention
    + @overdistention == rectovaginal and vesicovaginal septa
    + lined with rugae allows expansion. 
    + stratified squamous epithelium, no glands. 
    + @pregnancy, exposed to ++estrogen == produces ++glycogen == supports growth of lactobacilli == acidificiation through lactici acid == very acidic == -=risk of ascending infectin.
- uterine cervix
    + projects 1-2cm into the upper part of vagina.
    + is the lower 1/3 of the uterus, consists of the internal and external os (visible on vaginal examination)
- uterine body (fundus)
    + covered by visceral peritoenum expect @lower anterior part where the peritoenum is reflected over the bladder (the dip forming the pouch of douglas)
- uterine ligaments
    + broad ligament (double folds of peritoneum, connect to walls and floor of pelvis)
        * encloses fallopians, ovaries, ovarian artery, uterine artery, ovarian ligament, round ligament, suspensory ligament
    + uterosacral ligament
        * arise from lateral wall of the uterus and connect to anterior aspect of the sacrum
    + suspensory ligament of the ovary
        * fold of peritoneum that connects overy with the wall of the pelvis
    + ovarian ligament
        * arises from ovary to connect it with the lateral wall of pelvis
    + round ligament of the uterus
        * arises @uterine horns, exits the deep inguinal ring and continues onto majora and onto the surface of the pubis mons. 
        * maintains the anteflexion of the uterus

# Other terms
- vaginal introitus: opening of the vagina
- Skene's ducts
- rectovaginal and vesicovaginal septa
- nabothian follicles: cysts on the surface of the cervix that area caused @stratified squamous epithelium of the ectcervix grows over the endocervix (columnary epithelium)


# Abnormal anatomy
- uterine malformations 
    + caused by abnormal development of the mullerian ducts during embryogenesis. 
    + clinical features
        * sx:
            - amenorrhoea/ infertility/ recurrent miscarraige (3+ consecs esp 12-20 weeks)
    + classes (ASRM)
        * 1: mullerian agenesis (absent uterus) == primary amenorrhoea
        * 2: unicornuate uterus (banana shape uterus on imaging)
        * 3: uterus didelphys (both mullerian ducts develop but fial to fuse == double uterus)
        * 4: bicornuate uterus (only upper part of the mullerian system fails to fuse == heart shaped uterus)
        * 5: septated uterus: partition between the ducts present. most common uterine malformation. (partial or complete septation may be present)
        * 6: DES uterus (T-shape uterus)


#### Abnormal anatomy
    Ashermans syndrome (Intrauterine synechiae)
- acquired abnormalities
    + ashermans syndrome (Intrauterine adhesions)
        * post surgical adhesions (esp @DNC, CS, myomectomy, removal of RPOC) @intrauterine scarring == occlusion of internal cavity.
        * %@infections eg schisotomiasis, gennital TB 
        * clinical: infertility, second amenorrhoea, pain@menstruation
- congenital uterine abnormalities

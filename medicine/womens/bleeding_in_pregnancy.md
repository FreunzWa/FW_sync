###### Ante and post natal hemorrhage
    differentials of spontaneous abortion of pregnancy (miscarriage), incidental causes, ectopic pregnancy 

# Miscarriage
    25% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, higher @previous miscarriage
    ++@chromosomal abnormalities
- definition
    + presence of non viable intrauterine pregnancy before 20 weeks. (cutoff here @not viable)
- etiology
    + ++@chromosomal abnormalities
    + infection (TORCH)
    + medical conditions (APS, Lupus, Thyrotoxicosis, PCOS, obesity, diabetes, other severe disease)
    + toxins (tobacco and alcohol use or other teratogens)
    + trauma (CVS/ AC)
    + anatomical 
        * acquired: ashermans, endometrial polyps, cancer
        * congenital: mullerian malformations
- ddx
    + ectopic pregnancy
    + not pregnant (menstrual period)
    + incidental causees
    + intrauterine pregnancy (GTD, miscarriage, viable)
    + rule out cervical shock
- clinical features by type
    + threatened
        * bit of blood and pain
        * os closed
        * uterus size normal
    + inevitable
        * bit more blood and pain
        * os open
        * uterus size normal
    + incomplete
        * a lot of blood and pain
        * os open
        * uterus size decreased
    + complete
        * a bit of blood and pain
        * os closed
        * uterus minimal size
    + missed
        * no longer blood or pain
        * os closed
        * uterus minimal size
- examination
    + NO cervical excitation
- investigations
    + TV ultrasound will localise site of pregnancy and determine viable.
- mmanagement
    + %fluids, blood rarely needed
    + %analgesia
    + PGE1 misoprostol to extrude POC
    + DVC to remove POC
- complications
    + septic miscarriage
        * @POC neglected == offensive vaginal discharge, abdominal pain, fever esp @E coli, GAS. %sepsis and DIC.


# Primary Post-partum hemorrhage
    tone 70%
    tissue retained 20%
    trauma 9%
    thrombin deficiency 1%
- management
    + mechanical
        * fundal pressure (rub)
        * IDC
    + medications
        * syntocinon 5-10 mg IM
        * ergometrine (HTN, nausea) 250 mg IV/ IM
            - +maxolon/ondansetron (@N/V side effect of ergometrine)
        * carboprost 250mg
            - causes diarrhoea, thus give loperamide as well (unless ++opioids already taken)
    + surgical 
        * EUA (examination under anaesthesia to check for RPOC)
        * bimanual: 
        * balloon inflation
        * laporotomy: 
            - b lynch
            - embolisation
            - uterine artery ligation (doesnt work well)
            - hysterectomy

# Secondary post partum hemorrhage
    similar to primary pph, also associated with tone, tissue, trauma, thrombin.
    could be associated with infection. 
    managmenet is the same, high risk with surgery

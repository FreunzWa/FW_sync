###### Neonatal jaundice
    50% newborns first week of birth. similar process to adults for bilirubin production.
    80% of preterm infants develop jaundice.

# Neonatal bilirubin physiology 
- transferred to placeeneta == some cleared @matenral liver, otherwise cleared @developing fetal liver (gluconyl transferase system into conjugated bilirubin == enters fetal gut @water soluble)  
- serum bilirubin both unconjugated (indirect) and conjugated (direct) bilirubin. 
- 0.1% of unconjugated bilirubin travels unbound to plasma binding proteins (alb). this is fraction that passess BBB == kernicterus

# Neonatal jaundice causes
    physiological causes (50% get jaundice)

- physiological causes 
    + immaturity of gluconyl transferase system @newborn == ++unconjugated bilirubin 
    + @delay meconium passage == resortioon of bilirubin @cannot be converted into urobilinogen @no gut bacteeira
- pathological
    + prehepatic
        * hemolytic 
            - ABO and Rh haemolytic disease of the newborn
            - G6PD deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency
        * extravsacular blood
            - cephalohaematoma (@traumatic delivery)
        * polycythaemia
            - ttt
            - chronic fetal hypoxia == ++rbc formation
    + %%intrahepatic
        * infection
            - rare %@intrahepatic neonatal hepatitis @infection (TORCH infection)    
    
        * endocrine
            - %hypothyroidism
        * decreased trasnsoprt of conj out of liver
            - %%%congenital transport defect, hepatocyte damagee @genetic causes. 
    + posthepatic
        * %@biliary atresia/ choledochal cyst == very pale stool and green tinge @jaundice @conjugated form different.

# Red flag features in neonatal jaundice
- too early
    + @present <24 hours == ++@haemolysis. do FBE and coombs test and other haemolytic screen. ++@ABO/ Rh disease of newborn %@G6PD deficiency/ pyruvate kinase deficiency. 
- too high
    + @marked jaundice, usu @combinatiojn of causes. 
- too long
    + prolonged ejaundiice is that that lasts longer than 10-14 days. 

# Causes of prolonged jaundice
- breast milk jaundice
    + @breast milk stimulates reabsorption of bilirubin == higher levels of unconjugated billirubn. does not require phototherapy @the conc of bilirubin will not be high enough. 
    + usu occurs 1-2 weeeks after birth. 
- urinary tract infection
- hypothyroidism
- 


# Managmenet of neonatal jaundice
+ clinical features
    * lethargic baby
        - suggests possible sepsis
    * rule of thumb estimation of bili levels
        - jaundice spreads hands ==> feet (@head == 100, abdomen = 200, feet = 300)
+ investigations
    * conj bili/ unconj bili
        - @high conj == obstructive cause
    * septic screen
    * anaemia
+ management
    * phototherapy
        - does not work @conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
        - causes photoisomerisation of bilirubin in the skin == water soluble == excreted@liver and kidney without need to conjugate it. 
        - must commence if bilirubin is early @most commonly @haemolysis which will continue to rise. 
        - intermittent use may be just as effectgive. 
        - eyes are covered @UV == ++aging of the retina
    * exchange transfusion
        - replaces blood with cross matched blood to remove the bili. 
        - bonus @may correct anaemia and remove maternal antibodies to fetus


# Complications/ natural history of severe jaundice
- kernicterus
    + @severe unconjugated bili == ++unconj does not bind to binding proteins and @lipid soluble passess BBB easily == %reversible encephalopathy/ permanement brain damage. 
    + %opisthotonos , %with cries and seizures
    + @untreated == 
        * %death
        * choreoathetoid cerebral palsy
        * paralysis of upward gaze
        * sensorineural hearing loss

###### Neonatal jaundice
    50% newborns first week of birth. similar process to adults for bilirubin production.

# Neonatal bilirubin physiology 
- transferred to placeeneta == some cleared @matenral liver, otherwise cleared @developing fetal liver (gluconyl transferase system into conjugated bilirubin == enters fetal gut @water soluble)  
- serum bilirubin both unconjugated (indirect) and conjugated (direct) bilirubin. 
- 0.1% of unconjugated bilirubin travels unbound to plasma binding proteins (alb). this is fraction that passess BBB == kernicterus

# Neonatal jaundice causes
    physiological causes (50% get jaundice)

- physiological causes 
    + immaturity of gluconyl transferase system @newborn == ++unconjugated bilirubin 
    + @delay meconium passage == resortioon of bilirubin @cannot be converted into urobilinogen @no gut bacteeira
- pathological
    + prehepatic
        * hemolytic 
            - ABO and Rh haemolytic disease of the newborn
            - G6PD deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency
        * extravsacular blood
            - cephalohaematoma (@traumatic delivery)
        * polycythaemia
            - ttt
            - chronic fetal hypoxia == ++rbc formation
    + %%intrahepatic
        * infection
            - rare %@intrahepatic neonatal hepatitis @infection (TORCH infection)
        * endocrine
            - %hypothyroidism
        * decreased trasnsoprt of conj out of liver
            - %%%congenital transport defect, hepatocyte damagee @genetic causes. 
    + posthepatic
        * %@biliary atresia/ choledochal cyst == very pale stool and green tinge @jaundice @conjugated form different.


# Managmenet of neonatal jaundice
- evaluation
    + ++physiological and does not require managmenet. 
    + risk stratification
        * too early
            - jaundice first 24 hours ++@ haemolysis (%@ABO or Rh mismatch or G6PD deficiency)
        * too high
            - marked jaundice prompts investigation, exclude haemolytic causes but %high bilirubin @multiple physiological causes
        * too long
            - prolonged jaundice @>10-14 days, which usually has a variety of other causes. 
    + clinical features
        * lethargic baby
            - suggests possible sepsis
        * rule of thumb estimation of bili levels
            - jaundice spreads hands ==> feet (@head == 100, abdomen = 200, feet = 300)
    + investigations
        * conj bili/ unconj bili
            - @high conj == obstructive cause
        * septic screen
        * anaemia
    + management
        * phototherapy
            - does not work @conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
            - causes photoisomerisation of bilirubin in the skin == water soluble == excreted@liver and kidney without need to conjugate it. 
            - must commence if bilirubin is early @most commonly @haemolysis which will continue to rise. 
            - intermittent use may be just as effectgive. 
            - eyes are covered @UV == ++aging of the retina
        * exchange transfusion
            - replaces blood with cross maatched blood to remove the bili. 
            - bonus @may correct anaemia and remove maternal antibodies to fetus


# Complications/ natural history of severe jaundice
- kernicterus
    + @severe unconjugated bili == ++unconj does not bind to binding proteins and @lipid soluble passess BBB easily == %reversible encephalopathy/ permanement brain damage. 
    + %opisthotonos , %with cries and seizures
    + @untreated == 
        * %death
        * choreoathetoid cerebral palsy
        * paralysis of upward gaze
        * sensorineural hearing loss

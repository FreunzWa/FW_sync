# Neonatal respiratory distress
    Respiratory distress (>60 RR + accessory muscle use) 
        RDS is a subcategory ++@preterm neonate
    3% of newborns
- physiology
    + lung bud @4 weeks, saccules adequate @23-24 weeks
    + low pulmonary blood flow early @not used @bypassede by the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus
    + lung fluid: causes the ST, decreased @production of catecholamines and PGs which rise @labor
    + lung aeration: @sudden chest decompression == ++air into the lungs
    + breathing: normally 20-60, but 25-35 more specific wity periodic respiration normal, about 5-15 second windows.
- clinical diagnosis
    + RR > 60, assoc with chest wall (intercostal and subcostal) recessions and expiratory grunt
    + %hypoxia
    + %apnoea
- HEI
    + H: GA, rf @intrapartum spesis, meconium stained liquor?, use of CPAP? @reesus == ++Ptx risk
    + E: stridor (obstruction), catheter does not progress @nose (choanal atresia), PRS (retracted jaw), scaphoid abdomen (suggests diaphragmatic hernia), air entry (Ptx), hepatosplenomegaly/ heart murmur (CCF)

            - CXR shows air bronchograms and ground glass (looks like pneumonia)
        * pneumonia

        usu @DM mothers
        grade 1: >4kg
        grade 2: >4.5 kg
        grade 3: >5.0 kg
    terms of birth weight are used commonly but dont take into account GA so may lose information @use too much
    as with the question of FGR, the approach is:

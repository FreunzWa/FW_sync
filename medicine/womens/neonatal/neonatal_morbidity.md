        * prevent hypoxaemia and hypercapnia, maintain adequate BP, control seizures and prevent fluid overload
        * therapeutic hypothermia @severe HIE. (body temp 33-34 for 72 hours in neonatal ICU, must commence @first 6 hours)
        * @severe asphyxia == cardiac failure, require intortropes
    + complications

# Neonatal respiratory distress
    Respiratory distress (>60 RR + accessory muscle use) 
        RDS is a subcategory ++@preterm neonate
    3% of newborns
- physiology
    + lung bud @4 weeks, saccules adequate @23-24 weeks
    + low pulmonary blood flow early @not used @bypassede by the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus
    + lung fluid: causes the ST, decreased @production of catecholamines and PGs which rise @labor
    + lung aeration: @sudden chest decompression == ++air into the lungs
    + breathing: normally 20-60, but 25-35 more specific wity periodic respiration normal, about 5-15 second windows.
- clinical diagnosis
    + RR > 60, assoc with chest wall (intercostal and subcostal) recessions and expiratory grunt
    + %hypoxia
    + %apnoea
- HEI
    + H: GA, rf @intrapartum spesis, meconium stained liquor?, use of CPAP? @reesus == ++Ptx risk
    + E: stridor (obstruction), catheter does not progress @nose (choanal atresia), PRS (retracted jaw), scaphoid abdomen (suggests diaphragmatic hernia), air entry (Ptx), hepatosplenomegaly/ heart murmur (CCF)
    + cx of CLD @bronchopulmonary dysplasia == require O2 >28 days
- risk facotrs
    + preterm delivery
    + elective C-section without labor (associations and also lose the sudden decompression)
    + maternal diabetes
- etiology
    + obstruction
        * choanal atresia, PierreRobin syndrome, Laryngeal abnormalitiy (eg cleft)
    + airway and alveolar disease
        * respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) aka hyaline membrane diseaese
            - @prematurity (<32 weeks, with ++incidence @earlier) == -=surfactant == grunt, accessory muscle use, tachypnoea. occurs first few hours after. usu no surfactant use 24-48 hrs betamethasone IV hx
            - CXR shows air bronchograms and ground glass (looks like pneumonia)
        * pneumonia
        * MAS (meconium aspiration syndrome)
            - %causes inflammationa and obstruction
            - %mec aspiration from oropharynx and tracheae needed @severe resp compromise. 
            - cx of PTx
            - risk @postdates
        * lung hypoplasia
        * transient tachypnoea of the newborn
            - TTN @delay of fluid resorption usu takes place @labor.
            - treat @oxygen == resolves over hours-days
            - must rule out sepsis
        * tracheo-esophageeal fistula w/ aspiration
    + exstrinsic disesae
        * diaphragmatic hernia
            - @diagphragmatic defect == bowel in thorax == hypoplastic lung
            - %diag prenatally and %fetal surgery
            - treat @OGT to prevent swallow gas == further distention + surgery to return bowel
        * congenital lobar emphysema
        * pneumothorax
            - @air leak usu @postive pressure ventilation. requires needle drainage and chest drain.
            - %@MAS
    + non respiratory causes 
        * CCF @congenital causes
        * metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation == ++RR
        * sepsis
            - sepsis most common presentation is resp distress
- management (support before diagnosis can be made)
    + supportive 
        * incubator
        * airway
            - remove any obstruction, jaw thrust helps @PRS
        * oxygen to maintain sats 91-95 and -=cyanosis
            - non invasive ventilatory support (nCPAP +/- ventilation PEEP) -- esp @RDS
                + respires against added pressure to prevent atelectasis
        * exogenous inhaled surfactant
            - aerosol to baby through ET tube
        * prophylactic
            - IV betamethasone 24-48 hrs before anticipatede delivery, only protective @7-10 days and should be given @risk of birth <34 weeks
        * ECMO
            - %used @severe MAS or @obstruction
    + antibiotics (@presumed sepsis)
        * often give anyway @cannot rule out pneumonia/ sepsis
    + transfer
        * @FiO2 required >40% == transfer to ICU 
        * allows invasive monitoring with arterial catheter @umbilical / peripheral artery (allows blood gas and pressure reading)
        * IV fluids


# Small and large for GA infant
    Small for GA: <10% percentile at any generation
    Large for GA  >90 percentile at at any GA
        usu @DM mothers
        grade 1: >4kg
        grade 2: >4.5 kg
        grade 3: >5.0 kg
    terms of birth weight are used commonly but dont take into account GA so may lose information @use too much
    as with the question of FGR, the approach is:
        maternal factors
        placental factors
        fetal factors
- SGA 
    + rf: 
        * indigenous
    + causes (usu @FGR @...)
        * maternal 
            - severe malnutrition
            - TORCH
            - maternal hypoxaemia
            - mateernal substance abuse (++@EtOH/ cig)
            - indigenous/ younger/ older mothers == ++risk
        * placental
            - ischaemic placental disease
            - thrombotic disease affecting placenta
            - genetic abns of placenta
        * fetal
            - chromosomal abnormalities
            - Russell-Silver + other genetic
            - major congenital abns
            - twins
    + features
        * @asymmetrical GR
            - preservation of head circumfrence @maternal/ placental factors == affecting late pregnancy growth
            - thin skin @low subcut fat
        * symmetrical GR
            - issues since start of pregnancy, such as TORCH infection, alcohol, smoking
    + complications
        * hypothermia/ hypoglycaemia
            - @low fat stores == should have BSLs monitored
        * polycythaemia
            - @chronic hypoxia
        * birth depression
            - @placeental issues == poor o2 transfer == %hypoxia at birth
            - %@stressed == pass meconium == aspiration == MAS anad further respiraotry distress
        * long term
            - prognosis poor @symmetrical growth restriction
            - ++adult risk of IHD, HTN, CKD
- LGA (fetal macrosomia)
    + causes
        * ++@maternal GDM
        * syndromic
            - Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
    + complications
        * shoulder dystocia
            - brachial plexus injury
            - birth depression
            - clavicular injury
        * RDS
        * hypoglycaemia 
            - esp ++@DM in mother, should be monitored with 3-4 hourly BSls. 
            - caused @++exposure to BSLs in pregnancy @placenta == ++insulin required which lasts for 3-4 days post birth. 
        * polycythaemia

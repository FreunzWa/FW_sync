###### Fetal physiology

# Nutrition
- placental transport
    + glucose (50%), roughly same concentration as the mother (stored as glycogen in the last month)
    + ainno acids
    + lactate 20%
    + actetate 5%
    + essential fatty acids
- Body circulation
    + at 5 months
        * 85% water, 15% fat and solid
    + at term
        * 75% water, 25% fat and solid
    + 1 year after birth
        * 65% water, 35% fat and solid

# Fetal circulation
- umbilical vein joins the inferior VC, into RA ==> foramen ovale into left atrium ==> pumped to systemic circulation. then back to SVC ==> right atrium into the the RV ==> Ductus arteriosum ==> back to one of the two umbilical arteries
- if only 1 UA there is a higher chance of genital malformation
- distribution of CO in fetus
    + placenta 40%
    + brain 30%
    + lungs 4%
    + rest 18% (liver gut and kidney, bone and muscle)

# Oxygen transport
- oxygen ripped from higher affinity haeomglobin in the fetus to faciliate trasnport of O2 (alpha and gamma subunits in teh fetus)
- the fetus is living in low oxygen environment, thus have a higher total haemogloin (180g /L), but with a relatively low saturation ==> blue haemoglovbin, so neonates are blue at birth/ in the uterus
- fetal lung
    + alveoli start to develop 30-32 weeks, but premature to this the fetus can still survive from a small amount of fetal lung gas exchagne .
    + oligohydramnios can cause hypoplasia of the lunga sthe fetal lung fluid escapes into teh surrounding space
- surfactant
    + t

# Gut
- fetal swallowing from 22-24 weeks
- if not swallowing (eg @obstruction @esophageal atresia) == polyhydramnios == no fetal bowel movements and maternal bloating pain/ sensation


# Kindey
- +++pridction of dilute urine == production of amniotic fluid. @no kidney fialure == oligohydramnios == failure of the lungs to develop (hypoplastic lugns) == respiratory failure upon birth
- bladder urine is important sign to look for at first antenatal ultraosund (18 weeks)

# Neonatal transitioin (transition @delivery from fetus-->neonate)
    changes that occur gradually after delivery and the transition from fetus --> neonate
- gas exchange
    + stimulus to breathe after birth
        * cooling (of the face)
        * chemical (similar to chemoreceptors that drive breathing @adult)
        * pain? visual? auditory? 
        * head's reflex (positive pressure with mask can stimulate breathing)
- circulation
    + @loss of UA == ductus venosum lost == foramen ovale flap valve closes (which hen closes permanently more). DA actively constricts == forms a parallel circulation fairly quickly. (variable between babies)
- ashyxia
    + acute asphyxia (cord prolapse -- code green, due to compression fot the cord @presenting part, OR placental abprution OR ruptured uterus)
    + subactue (uterine hyperactivity -- causing a prolonged contracction --- marked on CTG as a pronlonged deceleration due to seere hypoxia, placental dysfunction)
- depression at birth
    + sedatives, shock, sleeping, submature
    + injuries 
    + anomalies
    + asphyxia 
    + excessive resuscittion
- resuscittion
    + aphar scores
        * respiratio, circulation and CNS function*

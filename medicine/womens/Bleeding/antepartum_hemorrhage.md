###### Antepartum hemorrhage

# Antepartum hemorrhage (APH)
    Ddx:
    Primary ddx
        placenta praevia (until proven otherwise) -- and dont perform VE until this is ruled out.
        abruption
        vasa praevia, rare
    Incidental
        Cervical polyp
        Cervical cancer
        Cervical ectropion
        CA
        lower genital tract infection
        trauma
    ----
    bleeding (>50 mL) in tthe 2nd part of pregnancy (>20 weeks). 
    ----
    3-5% of pregancies, and assoc with natal and maternal morbidity
    aimed @distinguishing between bleeding from a placenta praevia and placental abruption, vasa praevia. 
    responsible for ~50% of very preterm delivery
    increasing @placenta praevia increasing due to increasing C section rates.

    !assume to be due to placenta praevia until proven otherwise

- definition
    + variable definition, 20-50 mls after 20 weeks gestation
- distinct from  'show', which is the mucous plug lost in the weeks just before labor @cervical ripeninng due to baby head engaging with the cervix. 
- history
    + abdominal pain (makes more likely abruption)
    + US (placental location)
        * low lying placenta (placenta praevia)
        * velamentous placeta
    + fever (CA)
    + no history of CST (cancer)
    + trauma (trauma to lower genital)
    + assess for shock/ end organ compromise
- examination   
    + tense, tender uterus in placental abruption
    + HR and Blood pressure
    + speculum examination: look at cervix and rule out the lower genital tract causes. look for amount of blood loss.
- comlpications
    + haemodynamic shock
- management:   
    + large bore 2x cannulas
        * commence crystalloid (not colloid!)
    + take blood
        * FBE, group and hold, coagulation profiles.
        * Kleihauer test: fetal red blood cells looking for fetal-maternal hemorrhage
        * %UEC @possible pre-eclampsia
    + fetal wellbeing
        * comment on fetal movements, CTG, ultrasound
    + US
        * pregnancy US
        * placental position
        * fetal doppler (for chronic anaemia), AFI
    + blood transfusion
    + anti-D (@possible feto-maternal haemorrhage)
    + antenatal corticosteroids (fetal surfactant, bowel, brain - less IVH)

# Placenta previa (PP)
    the placent ai spartially or completely iplanted @the lower uterine segment
    dont perform digitial vaginal examination
    bleeding is all from the mother
    the degree of bleedinng proportional to degree of PP
    90% of women with PP have antenatal bleeding
    90% of low lying at teh 20 week US will become normal @placental migration @development of lower uterine segmennt @more vascular fundus.
- clinical
    + assoc with usu recurrent painless bleeds in 2nd/ 3rd trimester. 
    + 1/3 bleed before 30 weeks, 1/3 30-36 weeks, 1/3 after 36 weeks. amount and timing variable.
    + assoc with non tender uterus, high and mobile presenting part/ malpresntation @placenta occupies the lower uterine segment
- rf
    + previous cs
    + low lying placenta diagnosed (especially if diagnosed Later)
    + age
    + parity
    + IVF
    + smoking
- classification @either major or mnior praevia (replacing 
previous grading system)
    + major: covering os (any degree of covering)
    + minor: lower segment of the uterus but not covering the os (<2cm proximate)
    + anterior/ posterior
- investigations
    + 90% of low lying 20 week scan awill no longer be in region of cervix @delivery (placental migration @development of lower uterine segment)
        * low-lying is a placenta which is in the inferior uterus, includes both major and minor PP - at this point not called a PP
        * however @posterior placenta/ late diagnosis in pregnancy/ >25 cm overlap early scans
    + @diagnosed on 20 week morphology, organise followup scan at 32-34 weeks to confirm persistence/ exclude VP and PA
    + TVUS is more accurate. certainly do one @clinical suspicion -- see clinical features above.
    + DO NOT PERFORM a digitial vaginal examination @risk of severe hemorrhage, speculum is safer
    + pelvic ultrasoud for diagnosis, @diagnosed at 20 weeks, follow up at 32-34 weeks to confirm and exclude vasa praevia and placenta accreta
- management
    + asymptomatic (prophylaxis)
        * C-section at 37-38 weeks, even @asymptomatic woman with placenta praevia. 
            - C-section even @minor (<2cm of the cervical os)
            - @major == 37 weeks, @minor == 38-39 weeks.
        * avoid sexual intercourse which may cause bleeding
        * generally outpatient until 34 weeks esp @placental praevia major, then inpatient unless very close to hospital.
    + symptomatic placenta praevia
        * admit any GA
        * resus (iv access + fluids)
        * investigate: cross match, FBE, blood group, coagulation profile (@++bleeding). CTG @GA >26 weeks
        * @moderate-severe bleed usu inpatient until delivery
        * corticosteroids for fetal lung if delivery anticipated <34 weeks, magnesium sulphate @delivery before 30 weeks to reduce risk of cerebral palsy
        * delivery
            - @moderate ongoing CS >34 weeks
            - any bleeding from 36-37 weeks
        * dont delay delivery if theere is ongoing bleeding/ maternal compromise/ fetal compromise. 
        * tocolysis only @<34 weeks and minor bleeding.
        * after a bleed:
            - usu remain paitent until delivery @major PP or moderate-severe bleed. 
    + delivery with CS:
        * GA @heavy bleed
        * midline longitudinal skin incision in upper segment (@it contracts better)
        * use ergometrine/ oxytocin/ PGF2a, suturing bleeding placental sites, and other measures for PPH treatment.

# Placental abruption
    partial/ total detachment of placenta from decidual interface prior to delivery of fetus. 
    1% of pregnancies.   recurrence 10%
    amount of bleeding bad indicator of severity @concealed bleeding
[https://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Placental%20Abruption/item/122]
[decidua; modified mucosal lining ofthe uterus = the enodmetroium that forms @pregnancy @progesterone influence, forms the maternal part of the placenta. shed off @childbirth.]
[couvelaire uterus: severe abruption == bleeds into peritoneal cavity @penetrates through the myometerium]
- mx
    + appears to be @ischaemia of vessels in placenta bed ==necrosis of anchoring villi == placental separation
    + %@trauma eg MVA
    + %@polyhydramnios/ multiple gestation
- rf (basically something that causes unhealthy placenta)
    + HTN disorders (pre-ec, esp severe)
    + placental insufficiency causes (Diabetes, HTN, thrombophilia, smoking, CA)
        * thrombophilia esp @APS
    + maternal age, increasing parity
    + cocaine, smoking and other drug use
    + chorioamnionitis (@PPROM)
    + oligohydramnios
    + trauma (anchoring villi sheared @blunt trauma eg MVA)
- classification
    + mild: revealed BL < 200 ml
    + moderate: revealed BL > 200 ml and tense, tender uterus, %fetal compromise, %DIC
    + severe: FDIU + tense/ tender uterus, maternal haemodynamic compromise and DIC
- clinical
    + Classic: abdo/ back pain + vaginal bleeding
    + %back pain 
    + %contractions present
    + bleeding (however usu concealed bleeding so amount expressed is bad indicator)
- investigations
    + pelvic ultrasound to look for placental position and adherence to the uterus
    + cross match and FBE, coagulation profile if severe + kleihauer
    + CTG monitoring, maternal vitals, AFI, MCA doppler
- management
    + mild: admit until rule out moderate-severe. expedite delivery at about 38 weeks, fortnightly scans. @<34 weeks == steroids
    + volume resus, haem assessment, fetal wellbeing, kleihauer to check if feto-maternal hemorrhage, anti-d @rh negative mother, corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity. MgSO4 @<30 weeks
    + deliver @:    
        * >34 weeks
        * fetal compromise
        * maternal haemdoynamic compromise -- but must attempt to correct coagulopathy @DIC

# Vasa praevia
    fetal vessels go over region of internal os. when the vessels go lower than the presenting part of the fetus.
    either @velamentous cord insertion or due to fetal vessels running between two lobes of the placenta
    undiagnosed == 70% perinatal mortality
    bleeding is fetal
    1 in 2500 preegnanciues.
    100ml or more can lead to fetal shock and deaeth
- investigations
    + pelvic ultrasound
        * succenturiate placenta (multilobe placenta) increases risk
        * low lying placenta at 20 weeks
        * placennta praevia
        * twins
        * IVF
        * mebranous cord drainage
- clinical
    + pw bleeding after SROM or AROM and severe fetal compomise often with dark blood.
    + decreased fetal movements.
- assessment
    + CTG monitoring
    + US diagnosis
        * determine cord attachment site
        * lobes of placenta
- management
    + delivery
        * recommend CS at ~36 weeks to avoid possibility of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes == FDIU
        * can use steroids for fetal lung maturity

# Incidental 
    cervical ectropion
    cervical polyps
    cervical carcinoma
- usu follows sexual intercourse or clinical examination
- speculum examinantion may be done to rule out.
- esp to rule out cancer @recurrent small bleeds in womann without recent CST.

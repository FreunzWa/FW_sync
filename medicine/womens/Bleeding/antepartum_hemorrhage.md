###### Antepartum hemorrhage

# Antepartum hemorrhage (APH)
    Ddx:
    Primary ddx
        placenta praevia (until proven otherwise)
        abruption
        vasa praevia, rare
    Incidental
        Cervical polyp
        Cervical cancer
        Cervical ectropion
        CA
        lower genital tract infection
        trauma
    ----
    bleeding (>50 mL) in tthe 2nd part of pregnancy (>20 weeks). 
    ----
    3-5% of pregancies, and assoc with natal and maternal morbidity
    aimed @distinguishing between bleeding from a placenta praevia and placental abruption, vasa praevia. 
    responsible for ~50% of very preterm delivery
    increasing @placenta praevia increasing due to increasing C section rates.

    !assume to be due to placenta praevia until proven otherwise

- definition
    + variable definition, 20-50 mls after 20 weeks gestation
- distinct from  'show', which is the mucous plug lost in the weeks just before labor
- history
    + pain (makes more likely abruption)
    + US (placental location)
        * low lying placenta (placenta praevia)
        * velamentous placeta
    + fever (CA)
    + no history of CST (cancer)
    + trauma (trauma to lower genital)
    + assess for shock/ end organ compromise
- examination   
    + tense, tender uterus in placental abruption
    + HR and Blood pressure
    + speculum examination: look at cervix and rule out the lower genital tract causes. look for amount of blood loss.
- comlpications
    + haemodynamic shock
- management:   
    + large bore 2x cannulas
        * commence crystalloid (not colloid!)
    + take blood
        * FBE, group and hold, coagulation profiles.
        * Kleihauer test: fetal red blood cells looking for fetal-maternal hemorrhage
        * %UEC @possible pre-eclampsia
    + fetal wellbeing
        * comment on fetal movements, CTG, ultrasound
    + US
        * pregnancy US
        * placental position
        * fetal doppler (for chronic anaemia), AFI
    + blood transfusion
    + anti-D (@possible feto-maternal haemorrhage)
    + antenatal corticosteroids (fetal surfactant, bowel, brain - less IVH)

# Placenta previa
    the placent ai spartially or completely iplanted @the lower uterine segment
    dont perform digitial vaginal examination
    bleeding is all from the mother
    90% of women with PP have antenatal bleeding
- clinical
    + recurrent small painless bleeds assoc with non tender uterus, high presenting part/ malpresntation @placenta occupies the lower uterine segment
- rf
    + previous cs
    + age
    + parity
    + IVF
    + smoking
- grading @either major or mnior praevia (replacing 
previous grading system)
    + major: covering os (any degree of covering)
    + minor: lower segment of the uterus but not covering the os 
- investigations
    + 90% of low lying 20 week scan awill no longer be in region of cervix @delivery (placental migration @development of lower uterine segment)
        * however @posterior placenta/ late diagnosis in pregnancy/ >25 cm overlap early scans
    + DO NOT PERFORM a digitial vaginal examination @risk of severe hemorrhage, speculum is safer
    + pelvic ultrasoud for diagnosis, @diagnosed at 20 weeks, follow up at 32-34 weeks to confirm and exclude vasa praevia and placenta accreta
- management
    + asymptomatic
        * C-section at 37-38 weeks, @asymptomatic woman with placenta praevia. 
            - @major == 37 weeks, @minor == 38-39 weeks.
        * avoid sexual intercourse 
        * generally outpatient until 34 weeks, then inpatient unless very close to hospital.
    + symptomatic placenta praevia
        * resus (iv access + fluids + cross matching + ?transfusion)
        * @moderate-severe bleed usu inpatient until delivery
        * corticosteroids for fetal lung, magnesium sulphate @delivery before 30 weeks to reduce risk of cerebral palsy
        * delivery
            - @moderate ongoing CS >34 weeks
            - any bleeding from 36-37 weeks

# Placental abruption
    partial/ total detachment of placenta from decidual interface prior to delivery of fetus. 
    1% of pregnancies.   recurrence 10%
[https://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Placental%20Abruption/item/122]
- mx
    + appears to be @ischaemia of vessels in placenta bed ==necrosis of anchoring villi == placental separation
    + %@trauma eg MVA
    + %@polyhydramnios/ multiple gestation
- rf
    + placental insufficiency causes (HTN, thrombophilia, smoking, CA)
    + maternal age, increasing parity
    + cocaine and other drug use
    + oligohydramnios
- clinical
    + mild abruption have minimal pain, no fetal com-promise
    + @moderate-severe abruption assoc with tense tender uterus and ++painful. constant pain. sesvere abruption causes FDIU @DIC and maternal compromise
    + %back pain 
    + %contraction present
    + bleeding (however usu concealed bleeding so amount expressed is bad indicator)
- investigations
    + pelvic ultrasound to look for placental position and adherence to the uterus
    + cross match and FBE, coagulation profile if severe + kleihauer
    + CTG monitoring, maternal vitals, AFI, MCA doppler
- management
    + mild: expedite delivery at about 38 weeks, fortnightly scans
    + volume resus, haem assessment, fetal wellbeing, kleihauer to assess feto-maternal hemorrhage, anti-d, corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity.
    + if there is fetal compromose, then deliver, but must correct haemodynamic instability and coagulopathy before delivery

# Vasa praevia
    either velamentous cord insertion or due to fetal vessels running between two lobes of the placenta
    undiagnosed == 70% perinatal mortality
    fetal blood is lost from vasa praevia
- investigations
    + pelvic ultrasound
        * succenturiate placenta increases risk
- assessment
    + CTG monitoring
    + 
- management
    + delivery
        * recommend CS at ~36 weeks to avoid possibility of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes == FDIU

# Incidental 
    cervical ectropion
    cervical polyps
    cervical carcinoma
- usu follows sexual intercourse or clinical examination

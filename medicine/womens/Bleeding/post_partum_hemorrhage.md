# Post partum hemorrhage
    4% of pregnancies
    10% of direct maternal deaths

# Primary Post-partum hemorrhage
    The 4 T's
        tone 70%
        tissue retained 20%
        trauma 9%
        'thrombin' 1% - deficiency
    contract and empty the uterus
[defined @>500 ml bleeding within 24 hours from birth canal. Major PPH >1000mL]
- risk factors
    + prior PPH
    + chorioamnionitis
    + placental abruption
    + previous C section (placenta accreta). esp @multiplle C section
    + placental praevia
    + retained products of conception > 60 minutes
    + uterine overdistention (@multiple pregnancy)
    + prolonged labor/ instrumental birth
    + natural 3rd stage of labor (no administration of oxytocics)
- causes
    + 4 T's
        * tissue (20%) - even small amount of RPOC == inhibitin of the vessels in treh uterus to self occlude
            * esp @placenta accreta @deeply embedded placenta == does not detach == severe bleeding. %traverses into the bladder. rf @previous C section/ placenta praevia. usu requires hysterectomy.
            * either hysterectomy/ allow to pass may take weeks however risk fatal hemorrhage
        * thrombin
            - coagulation defect eg @DIC or pt deficiency 
        * trauma
            - @tear. more serious @upper vagina/ uterus/ cervix tears @larger vessels and difficult access.
                + should suspeect trauma @immediate bleeding post delivery
            - %@uterine rupture eg @obstructed labor/ prev C section/ trauma to the uterus
            - @cervical lacerations eg pushing against undilated cervix, hypertonic labor, traumatic teating of the cervix eg @forceps. vaginal packing useful for this and high wall vaginal lacerations
        * tissue
            - retained products of conception @failure to separate. @>60m mins == ++risk of PPH
            - manual removal required, internal hand to remove  + external hand pressure followed by EUA + proph antibiotics 
- management
    + call for help, iv lines, take blood for cross matching, FBE and coagulation (for theatre)
    + IDC in situ @many treatment will obstruct urethra.
    + contract the uterus
        * uterine massage (rub)
        * oxytocic: 
            * syntocinon 5-10 mg IM
            * ergometrine (HTN, nausea) 250 mg IV/ IM
                - +maxolon/ondansetron (@N/V side effect of ergometrine)
            * misoprostol rectally
            * carboprost 250mg / dinoprost
                - synthetic prostaglandin analgoue
                - causes diarrhoea, thus give loperamide as well (unless ++opioids already taken)
    + empty the uterus
        * apply cord traction/ pelvic pressure @avulsed cord
    + examine the lower birth canal for obvious cause of bleedeing eg laceration/ tear
    + surgical 
        * EUA (examination under anaesthesia to check for RPOC
        * bimanual: 
        * balloon tamponade/ packing
        * laporotomy: 
            - compression sutures (b lynch sutures). only effective for upper uterine bleeding site
            - embolisation 
            - uterine artery/ internal iliac ligation (only @++experienced in this technique, not used as much any more)
            - hysterectomy (last resort, but can be life saving @other measures insufficient)

# Secondary post partum hemorrhage
    almost always associated with infection + retained products of conception/ fragments of placenta.
    also associated with similar cause to primary postpartum hemorrhage
    managmenet is the same, high risk with surgery
[secondary PPH is any bleeding in excess of normal lochial loss between 24 hours until end of peurperium]
- treatment
    + investigate with Hb, vaginal swab for infection esp @discharge, USS to assess for RPOC
    + oxytocics
    + antibiotics

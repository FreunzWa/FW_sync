###### Heavy Menstrual bleeding
    adapted from Lecture "Heavy menstrual bleeding" delivered in women's term lecture block

# Definitions
    heavy menstrual bleeding: quality of life impacted.
    all of these underlying bleeding conditions are lumped under the heading HMB which itself is a subset of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB)
Old terms (now all AUB/ HMB)
[menorrhagia; abnormally heavy or prolonged bleeding]
[metrorrhagia; irregular intervals, esp between expected menstrual periods]
- normal menstrual cycle
    + menses (the actual bleeding period) last 3-7, avg loss 35 mls per cycle. 
    + 21-35 days duration (in adolescence more allowance is given to irregularity)
- menorrhagia (moving away from this term --> now "abnormal uterine bleeding")
    + over 80 mls per bleeding cycle, or prolonged (> 7 days)
    + "heavy uterine bleeding"
- metrorrhagia
    + irregular cycle and more frequent
- menometrorrhagia
    + prolonged or excessive bleeding occurring at irregular and more frequent intervals. 
        * prolonged: >7 days of bleeding
- Hypermenorrhoea
    + frequent periods, more common than every 21 days
- metrostaxis
    + acute very heavy bleed

# Heavy menstrual bleeding
    common, present in 10-20%, focus on the psychosocial impact 

# HEI
- History
    + age important @perimenopausal/ neoplasia risk, reproductive age?
    + presence of clots, how often having to change the pads (dont need to ask for an estimate as this is unreliable)
    + quality of life (sleep, work, needing to change clothes or no. of pads)
    + cardinal features: time course, past history. why NOW?
    + menstrual history: cycle length vs. now, intrauterine bleeding. 
    + assoc (features of anaemia, PCOS, infertility, cervical dysplasia features)
    + medical conditions (bleeding disorders), medications, contraception, allergies. fhx of bleeding disorders. 
        * medications: fish oil, high dose aspirin
    + gynae (CST) and obs history (did you get a PPH, did you need a blood trasnfusion), surgical hx
- examination
[get permission for speculum examination prior to starting any part of the examination]
    + vitals, anaemia features, bmi, pcos features, thyroid features, bruising
    + abdominal: tenderness, distended, masses, scars
    + gynae: usu not indicated. only speculum @IMB and/ or PCB for CST. TVUS is needed rather.  
- investigations
[FBE, TSH and Ferritin are the most important]
    + FBE or just Hbg (VBG)
    + Coagulation studies @indicated (eg @bruising or primary HMB)
    + FSH/ LH/ PRL/ estrogen/ PCOS investigations/ androgens/ DHEA/ testosterone/ SHBG
    + bHCG @need to exclude pregnancy
    + TSH (hypothyroidism)
    + Ferritin (gives most information rather than Fe) 
    + US: 
        * dimensions of the uterus, masses within the muscle fo the uterus (fibroids), diffuse swelling, polyps, endomterial thickness, comment on ovaries - normal?. 
            - postmenopause <4mm "normal"
            - non-postmenopausal (depends on age and time of month)
                + eg @day 14 of cycle will be thickest. 
                + anything above 15 mm is high regardless. 
                + often will take biopsy @4-12 mm with HMB
    + hysteroscopy and DNC (termed HDC). 
        * @use hysteroscopy == more likely to sample the right area. 
    + saline infusion hysterosonogrpahy (US technique, dont often do here. only do @not sre of the morphoboly/ anatomy of the uterus. old fashioned.)
    + MRI @unsure

# Causes of vaginal bleeding
    most common cause in teenagers is anovulatory DUB. 
    Medical vs. DUB vs. Uterine disorder
    PALM-COEIN (structural VS. non structural)
        Polyps
        Adenomyosis
        Leiomyoma
        Malignancy
        Coagulopathy
        Ovulatory dysfunction
        Endometrial
        Iatrogenic
        Not classified

    Some medical causes
        Coagulopathy
        Hypothyroidism
- dysfunctional uterine bleeding 60% (no obvious cause)
    + typically @irregular bleeding, 90% anovulatory. diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out anatomical cause
        * [10%] *ovulatory DUB* (endometrial causes): probably @++prostaglandin release == ++bleeding @decreasing platelet aggregation
        * [90%] *anovulatory *DUB*: @not ovulating, then less progesterone release due to no CL. == no anti-mitogenic to endometrium == overproduction ++bleeding (sloughing, can bleed for very long periods of time). irregular, long cycles. more likely @teenagers, and perimenopausal may cause Fe def anaemia. 
            - RF @PCOS/ perimenopausal @beginning of decreased ovulation
            - increases lifetime risk of carcinoma/ hyperplasia fo the endometrium @unopposed endometrium
- systemic cuases (endocrine, liver disease @coagulopathy)
    + hypo/ hyperthyroidism
    + prolactonima (anovulation == heavy periods)
    + PCOS (anovulation == heavy periods and associated features)
    + significant weight changes
    + bleeding disorders (vWF disease, plateelet function disorders, factor deficiencies, leukaemia). unlikely to be treatable 
- local causes (fibroids, polyps, cacinoma and infection)
    + 20% @over 30. ++asymptomatic, but can produce menstrual disturbance. only endometrial fibroids will impact on the menstrual cycle. %distended abdomen or fertility issues.
        * RF: nulliparity, obesity, family history
        * Rx: embolisation/ ablation, hyersteroscopic resetction, %hormonal treamtents
    + adenomyosis
        * endomterial glands within myometrium
        * present with bulky uterus %asymmetrical with heavy menstrual bleeding.
        * MRI and USS used for investigation.
        * hormonal treatment to induce amenorrhoea 
        * RF @multiparous esp @late 30s and 40s
    + carcinoma
        * usu postmenopausal. 
        * rf: chronic anovulatory cycles, upposed estrogen therapy, nulliparous, obesity and PCOS
        * diagnosed @endometrial smapling and histology and colposcopy (allows retrieval of the sample)  and CST for the cervix.
        * present @IMB, PMB, menorrhagia
- iatrogneic
    + COCP -- breakthrough bleeding
    + depot provera
    + implanon
    + IUCD esp Cu IUD, (%@mirena -- over 6-12 months get irregular spotting, thereafter stabilises. 95% reduction in blood loss with mirena)
    + anticoagulation (Factor inhibitors etc.)
    + chemotherapy == thrombocytopaenia 
- pregnancy complications
    + miscarraige
    + etopic pregnancy
- trauma (eg in pelvic or lower genital tract trauma)

# Assessment of menstrual bleeding
- severity
    + can ask if can get through a full night without changing pads (eg may use an alarm), do they put towels down
    + clots? -- important to reassure that this is normal for blood to do this when there is a lot.
- assocations
    + associated with pain (Esp @heavy bleeding ++dysmenorrhoea)
    + post-coital bleeding or dyspareunia (may suggst a secondary dysmenorrhoea eg @endometriosis)
    + pain at other times of the month/ defectation (may suggest endometriosis)
- finding risk factors
    + obs and pregnancy history
    + family history and easy bruising (bleeding disorders)
    + sexual history (endometritis and PID)
    + use of medications (eg blood thinners or contracpetive devices or hormonal therapy)
    + last CST (cervical cancer)
    + metabolic features (eg @PCOS)
- examiantion   
    + PCOS features (but dififcult sometimes @they may use lazer/ waxing to rid of hair)
    + BMI
    + petechiae
    + clammy/ cold/ BP/ postural drop/ tachycardia
    + abdominal pain, masses -- fibroids/ cancer (feel the uterus for fetus)
    + speculum examination not done @non sexually active
    + CST done, endocervical swabs for chalymydia and gonorrhoea

# Treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding
- nothing! (watch and wait)
- medical therapy
    + non hormonal
        * PG inhibitors
            - NSAIDs
            - Metenamic acid
        * antifibrinolytics
            - tranexamic acid (reduce by 20-30% but up to 50%)
    + hormonal treatments
        * COCP 
            - COCP can be used adolescents continuously, no effect on fertility in the long term.
        * depot provera
        * danazol
            - typically not used @androgen side effects
        * GnRH analogues
        * mirena can be very effective!
    + surgical treatment (after medication therapy, and if fertility is NOT desired)
        * uterine artery embolisation
        * my
        * endometrial ablation
            - recommend reliable contraception after this procedure (eg fertilisation or mirena)
            - 90% reduction in periods/ bleeding after the ablation. 60% satisfaction at 5 years
        * hysterectomy 
            - total
            - subtotal
            - +/- oophorectomy + salpingectomy (reduces the risk of ovarian cancer)

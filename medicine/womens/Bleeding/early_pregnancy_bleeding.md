###### Bleeding in early pregnancy
    differentials of spontaneous abortion of pregnancy (miscarriage), incidental causes, ectopic pregnancy 

    miscarriage (threatened/ inevitable)
    incidental bleeding
    ectopic pregnancy
    gestational trophoblastic disease
    normal menstrual period (not pregnant)

# Miscarriage
    25% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, higher @previous miscarriage
    ++@chromosomal abnormalities
    ++@First trimester, %2nd trimeester, 1% of pregnnacies. usu medical management to evict POC (misoprostol) or D&C
    recurrent miscarriage, affects 1% of couples. 
- definition
    + presence of non viable intrauterine pregnancy before 20 weeks. (cutoff here @not viable)
- etiology
    + ++@chromosomal abnormalities
    + infection (TORCH)
    + medical conditions (APS, Lupus, Thyrotoxicosis, PCOS, obesity, diabetes, other severe disease)
    + toxins (tobacco and alcohol use or other teratogens)
    + trauma (CVS/ AC)
    + anatomical 
        * acquired: ashermans, endometrial polyps, cancer
        * congenital: mullerian malformations
- ddx
    + ectopic pregnancy
    + not pregnant (menstrual period)
    + incidental causees
    + intrauterine pregnancy (GTD, miscarriage, viable)
    + rule out cervical shock
    + gestational trophoblastic disease
- clinical features by type
    + threatened
        * bit of blood and pain
        * os closed
        * uterus size normal
    + inevitable
        * bit more blood and pain
        * os open
        * uterus size normal
    + incomplete
        * a lot of blood and pain
        * os open
        * uterus size decreased
    + complete
        * a bit of blood and pain
        * os closed
        * uterus minimal size
    + missed
        * no longer blood or pain
        * os closed
        * uterus minimal size
- examination
    + NO cervical excitation
- investigations
    + TV ultrasound will localise site of pregnancy and determine viable.
- mmanagement
    + %fluids, blood rarely needed
    + %analgesia
    + PGE1 misoprostol to extrude POC
    + DVC to remove POC
- complications
    + septic miscarriage
        * @POC neglected == offensive vaginal discharge, abdominal pain, fever esp @E coli, GAS. %sepsis and DIC.


# Gestational trophoblastic disease

    Benign/ local
        Partial mole
        Complete mole
    invasive GTN (gestational trophoblastic neoplasia)
        invasive mole
        choriocarcinoma
        placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT)
[mole; edematous avascular villi with trophoblastic proliferation]
- clinical
    + usu present @vaginial bleeding, diagnosed on USS
    + %haemoptysis/ pleuritic pain @spread to the lung
- types
    + choriocarcinoma
    + partial mole (3% chance of malignancy)
        * chr: 69 XXY/XXX/XYY
        * present embryonic fetal tissue
    + complete mole (15% chance of malignancy)
        * chr: 46 XX or 46 XY
        * no fetal tissue present
        * common to get theca lutein cysts
- diagnosis
    + pelvic USS
        * mole: central heterogenous mass with numerous anechoic spaces, no fetus/ amniotic fluid
        * choriocarcinoma: hypervascular heterogenous mass
    + bHCG
        * universally elevated compared with ectopic/ intrautyerine pregnancies
- rx
    + local GTD
        + treat bleeding
        + suction curette for partial and incomplete molar + tissue diagfnosis of the removeed tissue
        + monitoring with ongoing serial B-HCG for 6 months to ensure resolution
        + COCP is safe to use
    + invasive GTN
        * chemotherapy (single vs multi agent depending on severity)
        * do not attempt repeat curette
        * follow up b-hcg usu for 12 months
        * COCP is safe
        * @risk of recurrence == should have USS in first trimester, placental histopathlogy and serum b-hcg at 6 weeks



# Ectopic pregnancy
    @implantation outside uterine cavity, usu tube
    1% pregnancies. increasing @IVF.
    must have very high level of suspicion for EP, esp @
- risk factors
    + nulliparous
    + pregnant
    + previous ectopic preg
    + use of POP or LNG-EC
    + PID
    + IVF
    + tubal damage or adhesions/ endometriosis
    + more severe @lower SE status @lower access to early pregnancy scans. @higher SE == more likely get dating scan, so more likely to find.
- types
    + tubal
        * tubal abortion: conceptus extruded out of fimbrial end == in abdomen == constant pain
        * tubal rupture: severe intraperitoneal bleeding and acute pain, shoulder tip pain, dyschezia, 
        * missed tubal abortion: the embryo is absorbed
    + cornual/ interstitial pregnancy:
        * @uterine musculature proximally, present later %with ++blood loss
    + cervical pregnancy
        * heavy bleeding esp @VE, small firm uterus above expanded cervix
    + uterine scar pregnancy
    + heterotopic pregnancy ++@IVF
    + abomdinal pregnancy
        * extremely rare, %after secondary implantation after a tubal abortion
- clinical
    + triad:
        * acute abdomen
        * vaginal bleeding
        * amenorrhoea (may not know pregnant)
    + adnexal tenderness
    + hypovolaemic sx
    + shoulder tip pain
- investigations
    + POC USS (empty uterus, adnexal mass)
    + serum bHCG (if not rising properly i.e. doubling, the bHCG cannot rise properly @cannot embed appropriately into the endometrium)
    + surgical (diagnostic laparotomy -- rule out appendicitis)
    + FBE/ Group and antivodies
- DDx
    + appendicitis 
    + UTI
    + ovarian cyst
    + utereteric stone
    + GI
    + MSK (of sxclusion)
- management
    + conservative, seldom done
        * if HCG <1000 and dropping, and no pain, and will represent @reliable. 
    + medical
        * MTX @no FH 
        * folinic acid blocker == stops developing pregnancy. must be asymptoatic. must be no contraindication to MTX.
        * especialy @previously had surgery and lost a tube.
    + surgical (@contraindications to medical treatment)
        * usu laparoscopic unless significant haemodynamic compromise
        * salpingectomy
        * salpingostomy
        * small reduction in fertility but the remaining tube will compensate. (if taken 2nd tube then only option remains IVF.)

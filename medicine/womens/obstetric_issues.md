###### Obstetric issues, emergencies and complications 
    Shoulder dystocia
    Caesarean section 
    Antepartum hemorrhage

# Shoulder dystocia
    defined @difficulty and time delay in delivering the fetal shoulders following delivery of teh fetal head. requires additional manoeuvres.
- 0.2-3%
- usually easy to deliver the shoulders, but some
- medical
    + mx
        * boney obstruction @bisacromial diameter (distance between shoulders) too wide @AP diaeter of maternal pelvis. 
        * also @cephalic presentation
    + classification by severity
    + Fetal complications
        * fracutres (clavicle, and humerus but the bones heal well w/ benign prognosis)
        * brachial plexus
            - %permanent
            - %transient (most self resolve)
        * cord compression (asyphyxia with hypoxic ischaemic ecenaphlopathy)
        * %%%death @prlonged asyphyxia
    + Maternal complciations
        * birth canal trauma and tears (Grade1-4)
        * %%uterine rupture
        * psychological impact
- clinical
    + risk facotrs
        * idiopathic (>50%)
        * past history of shoulder dystoci with pervious pregnancy
        * strongest assocation macrosomia >4500 g (eg @materal GDM or DM)
        * induction/ augmentation/ instrumental of labor
        * post-term pregnancy
    + diagnosis
        * difficulty delivering head after head with axial traction, head tightly applied to the vulva. 
        * chin retracts into the perineum (the tutrle sign) 'turtling'
- management   
    + aim to -=bisacromial diameter of the fetus
    + WARNINGS
        * NEVER rotate fetal head
        * AVOID excessive axial traction
        * AVOID fundal pressure
    + manoeuvres
        * max 30 seconds per manoeuvre, ask the patient to stop pushing, flat on the back
        * HELPERR 
            - help!
            - evaluate for episiotomy (allows more space for manoeuvres, not usually but may do @to get for posterior arm)
            - legs (McRoberts' manoeuvres)
            - suprapubic pressure
            - internal rotational manoeuvres
            - remove the posterior arm
            - roll the mother to hands and knees (Gaskin)
    + McRoberts (60-90% of cases amenable)
        * abductand hyperflex thigs onto maternal abdomen bil, obening maternal pelvis. one person on each leg.
        * GENTLE downward traction.
        * suprapubic pressure (pulsing pressure  constant or rocking motionto dislodge the shoulders)
    + If McRoberts does not work, then use Barnum
        * remove posterior arm by reaching in, apply pressure to antecubital fossa to flex the elbow in fron the body. then rotate fetus into oblique frame
    + Other internal manoeuvres
        * Rubin II (hand behind baby shoulder exerting pressure to rotate the bay)
        * Rubin II + Woods corkscrew
            - 2 hands to corkscrew the baby
        * reverse corkscrew
    + Gaskin position
        * patient on all 4s
    + last resort
        * intentional fracture of clavicle (thumb on anterior clavicle)
        * Zavanelli
            - feta l head is pushed up and held there until CS performed
        * hysterotomy
            - uterus incised and internal attempts made at rotating fetus
        * Symphysiotomy
            - division of the pubic symphysis
- prophylaxis
    + induction of labor for presumed future macrosomia may offer some benefit.
    + 

# C-section
    most common surgical operation, up to 1/3 babies are born @CS
- types
    + Emergency CS 
    + Eelctive
    + Hysterotomy (the uterine incision, but this term is usually only used <20 weeks or termination of pregnancy)
- indication
    + most common indication is previous C-section
    + @first operation, most common indication is fetal distress, labor dystoica (labor fails to progress)
- anaesthetics
    + spinal anaesthetics is the most common
    + GA uncommon @highest risk (4-5% prevalence)
- after birth
    + oxytocic adminsitration 
    + 2 layers repaired for the closure of the uterus
    + closure of peritoneum? 
    + thromboprophylaxis (actually little benefit)
    + lactation support
    + bladder care
- comlpications
    + increasing risk of placenta previa
- VBAC:
    + primary risk is uterine rupture (1;200)
    + chance of success determined @maternal age/ obsesity
    + requirement
        * singleton cephalic fetus
        * continuous monitoring
        * immediate access to OT

# Antepartum hemorrhage (APH)
    Ddx:
    Most common
        placenta praevia
        abruption
        vasa praevia
    Incidental
        Cervical polyp
        Cervical cancer
        Cervical ectropion
        CA
        lower genital tract infection
        trauma
    ----
    bleeding (>50 mL) in tthe 2nd part of pregnancy (>20 weeks). 
    ----
    3-5% of pregancies, and assoc with natal and maternal morbidity
    aimed @distinguishing between bleeding from a placenta praevia and placental abruption, vasa praevia. 
- definition
    + 50+ mls is minimum requirement for antepartum hemorrhage. 
- distinct from  'show', which is teh mucous plug lost in teh weeks just before labor
- history
    + pain (makes more likely abruption)
    + US (placental location)
        * low lying placenta (placenta praevia)
        * velamentous 
    + fever (CA)
    + no history of CST (cancer)
    + trauma (trauma to lower genital)
    + assess for shock/ end organ compromise
- examination   
    + tense, tender uterus
    + HR and Blood pressure
    + speculum examination: look at cervix and rule out the lower genital tract causes. look for amount of blood loss.
- comlpications
    + haemodynamic shock
- management:   
    + large bore 2x cannulas
        * commence crystalloid (not colloid!)
    + take blood
        * FBE, group and hold, coagulation profiles.
        * Kleihauer test: fetal red blood cells looking for fetal-maternal hemorrhage
        * %UEC @possible pre-eclampsia
    + CTG
    + US
        * pregnancy US
        * placental position
        * fetal doppler (for chronic anaemia), AFI
    + blood transfusion
    + anti-D (@possible feto-maternal haemorrhage)
    + antenatal corticosteroids (fetal surfactant, bowel, brain - less IVH)

# Placenta previa
    the placent ai spartially or completely iplanted @the lower uterine segment
    dont perform digitial vaginal examination
    bleeding is all from the mother
- grading @either major or mnior praevia. 
    + major: covering os (any degree of covering)
    + minor: lower segment of the uterus but not covering the os 
- investigations
    + DO NOT PERFORM a digitial vaginal examination @risk of severe hemorrhage, speculum is safer
- management
    + C-section at 37-38 weeks, @asymptomatic woman with placenta praevia. 
        * @major == 37 weeks, @minor == 38-39 weeks.

# Vasa praevia
    no longer do APT test
- assessment
    + CTG monitoring
    + 
- management
    + 


# Breech
    97% cephalic presentation @term
- risk factors (change of shape of fetus and uterus)
    + fibroids/ malformations (eg bicornuate uterus)
    + polyhydramnios/ prematurity (rounder uterus)
    + placenta positioned inferiorly
    + hydrocephaly
    + grandmultiparous (@uterine laxity)
- hei
    + past history of baby breech
    + e: belottable fetal head high
- complications
    + cord prolapse @ROM because the head does not block the cervix (in breech the liquor escapes around the leg)
- investigations
    + hip dislocation congenitally @US prior to deliery
- management
    + @present @36 weeks == often wait for baby to invert (4% have breech at 36 weeks)
    + @still breech @37 weeks
    + ECV: external cephalic version done from 36-37 weeks, earlier pointless @high chance of spontaneous version. more difficult @fetal leg extension or nulliparous
        * Risks: feto-maternal hemorrhage, placental abruption, cord entanglement -- so give RhD
        * CIs: @already plan elective CS, antepartum hemorrhage, oligohydramnios, uterine scar, multiple pregnancy
        * can give terbutaline to soften uterus. 
        * CTG before and afterwards
    + elective CS 39-40 weeks
    + planned vaginal breech birth (%@multiparous)
        * negative outcome predictive facotrs
            - large fetus (3.8 kg+), small fetus (@preterm), placental insufficiency, fetal head extension, footling breech, evidence of cephalopelbic disproportion
        * First stage
            - NPO @requirement for emergency surgery
            - exclude cord prolapse as soon as waters break
        * Second stage
            - lithotomy position
            - routine episiotomy @tight perineum
        * maneurvres
            - burns-marshall method (swing feet upwards)
        * complications
            - failure to deliver head (fetal hypoxia)


# Transverse lie
    no mechanism for delivery, must either be corrected or CS.
    1 in 200 @37 weeks GA
- rf
    + similar to breech, but ++@multiparity (@hypotonus of the uterus and anterior abdominal wall).
    + placenta location esp placenta praevia
- hei
    + can see transverse on inspection of abdomen @lateral expansion.
    + no fetal pole palpable @the fundus or the lower uterus
    + US confirmation, must also look for placenta praevia esp @not multiparous
- rx
    + ECV, but ++revert to transvere
    + @>38 weeks present == admit to hospital for monitoring until lie corrects or CS @PROM (high mortality if not at hospital). can DC @lie stable for 48 hours
    + CS difficult @poorly developed lower part of uterus == difficult to grab presenting part, can vert the baby @sufficient liquor fairly easily.
- complicatrions
    + cord prolapse and fetal death

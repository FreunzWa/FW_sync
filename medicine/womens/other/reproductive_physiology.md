###### Reproductive physiology
    uterine vs. ovarian cycles
    uterine: refers to the waxing and waning of the endomtetrium
    ovarian cycle: refers to the follicular development and subsequent corpus luteum formation and maintenance.

# Menstrual cycle
- initiated @pulsatile secretion of GnRH @hypothalamus == secretion of the gonadotropins (FSH and LH) from the anterior pituiatry
- Follicular phase (Day 0-14)
    + FSH == granulosa cells to produce estrogen == stimulates endometrial vascular proliferation and stroma/ epithelial cells. 
    + Estrogen prevents further release of FSH
- Ovulation (day 14)
    + rising estrogen get to threshold to cause ++LH surge == the mature ovarian follicle releases the ovum 30 hours later. 
    + usu on day 14 of 28 day cycle. 
    + ovum passes to fimbrial end of the fallopian tube
- Luteal phase (Day 14-28)
    + LH == theca and granulosa cells develop into corpus luteum == progesterone production. 
        * theca cells produce androstenedione that the neighbouyring granulosa cells use to produce estradiol. (@PCOS == too much androstenedione)
    + progesterone == cellular differentiation in the endometrium == -=proliferation further. 
- Menses (day 0-4)
    + @LH and FSH falling == estrogen and 



# Folliculogenesis
    process of generation of preovulatory follicles from small primordial folllicles stored in the cortex of the ovaries.
    the follicle houses the oocytes, matures them.
- follicle structure
    + flat squamous granulosa cells surround the oocyte, separate from the ovarian environment @basal lamina. 
    + can remain dormant approx up to 50 years.
- phases of development
    + primordial 
        * dormant, small, only one layer of flat granulosa cells surrounding the oocyte
    + primary
        * mitotic cells, cuboidal granulosa cell
        * oocyte genome becomes activated
        * communication between the granulosa cells and the oocyte
        * zona pellucida develops around the ooccyte, separate it from the granulosa cells. 
    + secondary 
        * theca cells are present, recruited @oocyte secreted signals. 
        * multiple layers of granulosa (~9 layers)
        * Graafian follicles/ Antrum follicles
            - follicles that have formed antrum (antral follicles)
    + early tertiary
    + late tertiary
    + preovulatory
        * all of the other follicles are atresic/ dead
    + ruptured follicle == release of the oocyte
    + corpus luteum


# Corpus luteum
    secretes
        estrogen (small amount but estroigen still drops in this phase)
        inhibin
        progesterone
- inhibin
    + inhibits FSH release @do not need any more follicles to develop.
- progesterone
    + suppresses GnRH release (-=FSH and LH) 
    + anti-mitogenic at the endometrium, but converts the endometrium into the secretory phase. 
    + with estrogen, progesterone maintains the endometrial thickening. 
    + @eventual death of the corpus luteum == no progesterone == endometrium cannot be maintained == sloughing and menses will result.
- survives for ~10 days from the 14th day of ovulation, after which it decays into the corpus albicans.

# Gametogenesis
- only 1 ovum per cycle
- gametes formed with 23 chromosomes @meiosis, with only 1 copy each of the 22 autosomes, and then one sex chromosome.


# Sexual hormonal development
- fetal oogenesis
    + 4-5 million follicles housing the primordial follicles stroed @the corex. this is the peak.
- prepubert
    + HPA is hypersensitive to negative feedback of the very low levels of sex hormones == FSH and LH remain at very low levels == no estrogen and progesterone production == external physical characteristics remain in the nubile form
- puberty
    + HPA develops progressively, with -=sensitivity to gonadal sex steroids == they are low and so FSH and LH are produced to produce estro and P at higher levels == first ovulation.
    + about 180,000 by puberty. only 400 will ever make it to the preovulatory stage @inefficient nature of Folliculogenesis
- menstrual cycles
    + HPA stimulates the ovary in a cyclical manner. usu 28 days
- Pregnancy
    + HCG from the trophoblast cells maintains and stimulates the corpus of pregnacny == maintains estrogen and progesterone levels until placenta takes oveer. corpus degrades @13 weeks
- postmenopause
    + ovary no longer has oocyutes, thus there are no lutein or granulosa cells ready to make estrogen and progesterone == no estrogen == very high levels of gonadotropins
    + estrone is procued @ovarian stromal cells to ameliorate some of the effects of estrogen withdrawal.

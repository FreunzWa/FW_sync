###### Red cell alloimmunisation
    alloimmune disorders (antibody against something the mother does not have, so the mum's body attacks the baby)
    autoantibodies, attacks the mother as per normal, 

# Alloimmune disease in the mother
- thyroid autoimmune disease
    + Graves disease/ Hashimotos' disease abs cross placenta, however @conventional treatment also crosses the placenta.
    + antiAbs half life <3 months == not an issue after birth
    + however @thyroid ablation == still crosses placenta == baby gets severe thyroid disease
- connective tissue diseases
    + SLE: anti-dsDNA == failure to thrive in the fetus 
    + Sjogrens: anti-Ro/ La antibodies == fetal heart esp in bundle of His == risk of complete heart block and cardiomyopathy
- immune thyrombocytopaenic pupura (ITP - most common autoimmune condition)
    + fetal thrombocytopaenia: treated with immunoglobulin (-=the autoantibody) and corticosteroids, this usually treats the fetus as well. 

# Maternal iso-antibodies (aka allo-antibodyies) - non red cell 
- perinatal allo-immune thrombocytopaenia
    + spontaneous bleeding @mucous sites and brain
    + treated with immunoglobulin @suppressess Ig production.
- perinatal allo-immune neutropaenia
    + not an issue in utero
    + bacterial sepsis
    + isolation, antibiotics, donor Ig to boost immune stocks, G-CSF. (no white cells @graft vs. host disease!)

# Red cell alloimmunisation
- red cell antigens that are targets
    + can kill Red cell antigens
        * Rhesus D/E/c/K (anti-D is the largest problem)
        * Kell/ Kidd/ Duffy (antiAbs also kill bone marrow - that is why Kell kills == more profound anaemia)
        * MNS (anti M/N/S)
    + harmless
        * ABO: anti-A and B are harmless @IgM does not pass into the fetus @placenta
        * Lewis: fetal red cell does not express the lewis antigen
        * P antigens: IgM
- epidemiology
    + 99% have no abs to red cells. 85% are anti-RhD. 15% others.
- consequences to the neonate (abs remain after pregnancy)
    + mild (usu ab titre <32)
        * mild jaundice
    + moderate (usu ab titre 64-256)
        * severe jaundice (kernicterus)
        * mild anaemia
    + severe
        * severe anaemia (usu ab titre >512)
        * hydrops (generalised edema, pericardial effusion and ascites)
        * FDIU
- pathophysiology
    + primary immunisation
        * blood transfusion
        * feto-maternal hemorrhage
            - spontaneous: usually after 28 weeks
            - trauma (CVS, amniocentesis, version @breech baby, MVA)
                + amniocentesis usu only small 
            - most commonly @delivery == immunisaton for next pregnancy
                + delivery further boosts the titre if prev small feto-maternal hemorrhage (secondary exposure == ++high levels)
- management
    + first antenatal visit
        * iso-immunisation assessment
            - partner grouping
                + if partner negative, then no risk of red cell alloimmunisation
                + if homozygous == 100% affected. 50% affected @heterozygous
            - fetal DNA testing
                + amniocentesis (not CVS @risk feto maternal hemorrhage)
            - risk allocation
                + ab titre
        * book in for specialist maternal/fetal medicine practitioner
    + according to risk
        * low risk
            - Ab titre (by dilution) at each visit, take a titre every 4 weeks  
            - @stays stable == deliver @38 weeks @there is a large rush of Abs across placenta late preg
                + MCA Doppler: peak systolic velocity (-=viscosity of blood == ++velocity.) measured as multiples of mean.
        * medium risk
            - monitor at each visit
            - US screening from 20 weeks (MCA)
                + MCA (increase @hypoxia == vasodilation)
            - CTGs from 32 weeks
            - deliver 38 weeks or earlier to reduce Ab load.
        * high risk
            - US screening from 17 weeks. (before this placenta is not permeable enough)
            - @evidence of fetal anaemia == take blood from ubilicus to see if aenamia. @anaemic == fetal irradiated blood transfusion (remove white cells to stop graft vs. host)
                + use mothers type @the mother will not have that antibody against that red cell type (the antigen in question)
                + give O -ve in general.
                + giving mothers blood okay as long as spin off the plasma. (however not a long term solution)
    + management
        * transfusion:
            - paralyse the baby with fecuronium
            - US guided intrahepatic portion of UA blood transfusion. (cordocentesis) and also intraperitoneal cavity of fetus == absorbed gradually
- prevention    
    + if need blood tranfusion, use RhD compatible blood 
    + Kell Negative blood to women under 50 years (men given kell positive blood)
    + anti-D given (stops the white cells from detecting the red cells with D antigen)
        * given whenever there is bleeding in pregnancy/ routine at 28 weeks and 34 weeks
        * no point in giving it if she is already immunised (eg with a high antibody titre)

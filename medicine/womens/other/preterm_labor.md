###### Preterm labor/ birth
    preterm labor = labor < 37 weeks pregnancy.
    preterm birth = birth < 37 weeks pregnancy.
    (includes iatrogenic causes, which account for 1/3)
- epid
    + ~12%, 2/3 are spontaneous

# Etiology
- iatrogenic (1/3 cases)
    + @prec: severe maternal compromise @hyretension/ end organ dysfunction.
    + FGR: @fetal compromise/ hypoxia
- spontaeneous
    + SROM (%@infection or uterine overdistention)
    + APH (placental abruption == uterine irritability == labor)
    + infection (esp CA, UTI may cause PG release == labor)
    + uterine malformation (eg bicornuate or unicornuate)
    + previous preterm birth
    + short cervical length
    + low SE status


- investigations
    + @fetal fibronectin (fFN) swab from cervicovaginal secretions , determines likelihood of imminent delivery.
    + vaginal swab (GBS carrier status)
    + CTG: monitor fetal wellbeing, and maternal contractions.

# Treatment
- principles (STATIN)
    + steroids (fetal lung maturity)
        * betamethasone IM, or dexamethasone IM (oral coticosteroids will not pass the placenta)
        * recommended @24-34 weeks GA
    + transfer + admission (for further assessment)
    + antibiotics (prevent infection @ROM)
        * cover GBS @most will be GBS unknown, should be BSAs that cover UTIs or other causes
    + tocolysis (slow delivery)
        * CI'd @:
            - GA beyond 34 weeks
            - APH
            - ROM
            - fetal distress
            - suspected infection
        * used @25% of women, generally to allow course of steroids to be completed or @too early to deliver.
        * usu given for 48 hours to allow trasner and give corticosteroids.
        * classes
            - Ca channel blockers (nifedipine), well tolerated
            - Beta-agonists (tertbutaline, ritodrine, salbutamol), however Ca blockers better
            - Oxytocin-R antagonists: Atosiban (not used @low efficacy)
            - COX-inhibition (eg indomethacin), but poorly tolerated. and fetal side effects (PDA closure prematurely.)
    + intrapartum care
        * active CTG
    + neuroprotection
        * MgSO4 -- reduced risk of cerebral palsy


# PPROM - preterm premature rupture of membranes
    spontaeneous prelabour rupture of the membranes prior to 37 weeks GA
- risks
    + infection (CA)
    + preterm labor (PPROM usu predicts delivery within 1 week)
    + malpresentation
    + placental abruption
    + cord prolapse (more likely @malpresentation more likely)
    + anhydramnios == fetal lungs cannot develop.
- clinical
    + sudden gush of fluid from the vagna, soak pads/ underwear.
- examination
    + vital signs: tachy and fever
    + abdo: fundal height, fetal presentation
- management
    + siilar to managemnet of preterm labor (STATIN)

# Cervical insufficiency
    painless dilatation of the cervical os == recurrent T2 pregnancy losses. 
- medical
    + causes:
        * ED syndrome
        * uterine abnormalities
        * previous trauma to the cervix/ past biopsy of the cervix.
- management
    + cervical cerclage:
        * insertion of non absorbable suture encircles the cervix, provides resistance. 
        * suture inserted 12-14 weeks, removed 36-37 weeks to allow spontaneous delivery
    + progesterone treatment
        * @short cervical length == use progesterone to suppress smooth muscle activity and reduces prostaglandin synthesis. 
    + Pessary

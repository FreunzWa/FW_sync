###### Obesity pregnancy
- basics
    + during pregnancy, weight increases. even @start @normal weight if gain weight == similar issues to starting obese
- epidemiology
    + in australia, 50% at normal weight/ 50% overweight (20% obese)
- medical
    + complications
        * increases risk of
            - hypertension
            - GDM
            - C-section need
            - birth <34 weeks
            - VTE disease
            - congenital abnormalities
            - breastfeeding difficulties
            - anaesthetic difficulty
            - SGA
    + misconceptions
        * may overestimate weight gain requirement during pregnancy. actually not that much more is required.
    + gaining weight
        * weight gain targets during pregnancy
            - normal weight 11.5-16 kg
            - overweight 7-11.5 kg
            - obese 5-9 kg
        * caloric requirement
            - T1: no additional requirement (no weight gain)
            - T2: 15% over. 1400 kj extra (2 slices bread + some nuts)
            - T3: 20% over. 1900 kj extra (2 slices bread, + some nuts + 1/2 cup of beans)
- management
    + DVT prophylaxis post-partum
    + bariatric surgery
        * increased fertility bost BS
        * reduced risk of HT and GDM
        * however increased risk of IUGR and perinatal morbidity
- investigations
    + early OGTT
        * OGTT used because that is the best studied. HbA1c not enough research.
    + scans for IUGR - though US is more difficult
    + early anaesthetic review


# Diabetes in pregnancy
- basics
    + @fetal demand == improvement in glucose tolerance in T1, but T2 == ++insulin required (due to human placental lactogen). 
    + T1DM/ T2DM equally split, about as equally bad as eachother, but much worse outomes

# Gestational diabetes
- continuum of glucose levels in pregnancy, as glucose tolerance decreases == outcomes worsen. however there is an arbitrary cutoff.
- screening: done in all women at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy
- definition
    + OGTT (24-28 weeks)
        * fasting >5.1
        * 1 hr >10
        * 2 hour >8.5
- outcomes
    + obstetric
        * macrosomia (higher requirement for C-Section)
        * shoulder dysotica
    + neonatal:
        * jaundice
        * resp distress
        * birth drauma
        * hypoglycaemia
    + maternal outcomes:
        * 25% risk of T2DM at 15 years
    + generational
        * ++CVD and diabetes
- treatment of GDM
    + treatment reduces pre rates, lower C-section rates, -=birth size, less shoulder dystocia
    + compliance may be an issue @medicalising women asymptomatic
    + non pharm
        * diet
        * home blood glucose monitoring (fasting and 2 hours post-prandial)
    + pharm (OHG not that well tolerated @pregnancy)
        * insulin (1/3 of GDM women, who feel well)
            - protaphane + novorapid
        * metformin %used (safe in pregnancy) but not commonly used
- investigations
    + fetal surveillance
    + timing of delivery (attempt to have smaller babies, -=risk of obstructed labour and shoulder dystocia)
        * GDM on diet (40-41 weeks)
        * GDM on insulin (38-39 weeks)
    + mode of delivery
        * @4.5kg, can use CS to reduce risk of shoulder dystocia
- generational effects
    + increased risk of childhood obesity

# Type 1/2 diabetes in pregnancy
- outcmes
    + pre-term delivery, Pre, C-section and macrosomia very common. 
    + neonatal
        * ++congenital abnormalities (eg spina bifida, stillbirth)
        * macrosomia, birth trauma
        * RDS, intensive care support often required.
        * similar to GDM but much worse
- predicting adverse outcomes
    + HbA1c at time of conception: pre-preg control of DM very important. @HbA1c > 10% == 1/5 serious outcomes.
- managemnet
    + pre-pregnancy counselling: optimise control of DM, change from OHGs to insulin. + normal standard pre-pregnancy counselling

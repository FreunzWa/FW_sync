###### Post-natal care and lactation (peurperium)


# Uterus
- @end of pregnancy extreme dilation (normal fist), must retract ~2 weeks. 
- afterbirth pains (contractions after birth, worse @breastfeeding women). lasts few days
    + reassure and analgesia
- postpartum period (lochia: blood and decidua, mucous). ~200-500ml lost in this period. up to 4-6 weeks after delivery. usu red --> yellow/ clear substance


# Cardiovascular
- physiological hemodilution, expansion of plasma == anaemia. resolution of edema.

# Haematological
- hypercoagulable state (adapted to stop haemorrhage). 
    + also @smoking, pre-eclampsia, genetic risk


# Lactation
- composition
    + 4% fat, mainly TG, phospholipids
    + carbohydrates: lactose, oligosaccarhides
    + proteins: casein, lactoferrin, IgA, lactalbumin
    + minerals: Na, K, Cl, Mg, Ca
- benefits:
    + nutrtionally perfect @digestion
    + -=in SIDS, obesity/ HTN, nutritional, evidence of decreased atopy. 
    + -=infections, mortality, diarrhoea
    + IQ increase
- benefits to mother:
    + contraceptive effect
    + -=rates of breast cancer, oarian cancer, CVD
    + oxytocin encourages involution oft he uterus == less blood loss
    + cheap
- WHO recommendations
    + 6 months exclusive, continue for up to 2 years (esp @developing countries). 6 months 45% now.
- contraindications
    + HIV 
    + medications
        * approx 1% of drug == passes to infant. esp contraindicated @ergotamine, MTX, cyclosporine, radiopharmaceuticals
    + LactMed online run by NIH good recommendations for breastfeeding
- successful breastfeeding
    + talking about antenatal (past experience, forseen dififculties)
    + early skin/skin contact within 1 hour of delivery (greatly increased ++successful breastfeeding). %will breastfeed. 
    + encourage demand feeding (only when baby is hungry)
    + avoid dummies and supplmental formula feeds

# Physiology of lactation
- pregnancy == estrogen/ progesteone, HPL, prolactin == growth of breasts
- @delivery == fall progesterone == allows prolactin to increase
- milk ejection == nipple stimulation == oxytocin release
- maintenance of lactation (supply/ demand): prolactin is increased by feeding
- cannot measure hormone levels to determine if breastfeeding well.

# Early breastfeeding
- colostrum (thick, small volume), 0.5-5 ml, yellow, lipd and immunoglobulin rich
- "milk coming in", from day 3-4. suddenly ++milk, blue/white 800ml/day. mother notes increased breast size and can sense the milk inside. uncomfortable.

# Breastfeeding problem
- sore nipples
    + most common, 50% primips in the first 3 weeks (cracked, bleeding nipples)
    + usu @positioning problems. encourage wide mouth, areolar within mouth
- engorgement
    + @too much milk accumulated (esp @the start). difficult for baby to attach @breast too big. should express some milk from breast to soften the breast.
    + firm bra, cold packs, analgesia to amange
- low supply
    + signs: baby takes less time to feed, baby feeds more often, breasts feel softer, baby is unsettled, baby settles better on formula, growth slows after 3 months, passing smal amounts of concetrated yellow strong smelling urine, infrequent hard green stools. 
    + manage: increase supply @increase number and duration of feeds, offer both breasts each feed, express after feeds. medication role unclear.
- structural problems
    + surgery, nipple problems
- mastitis
    + @staph aureus
    + @blocked duct == breast infection/ indurated
    + must keep feeding to empty the breasts
    + use Abx (fluclox) either PO/ IV depending on how bad
    + @abscess requires prompt drainage


# Early postnatal care
- in hospital
    + 2 night primiparous
    + 4 nights @C-section
    + review:
        * general appearance
        * Temp/ BP/ HR
        * Uterus involution
        * Wound
        * Urinary/ bowel function
        * BReast nipple function/ signs
    + allied health:
        * social worker, physiotherapy, dietician


# Psychosocial adjustment
- very difficult adjustment to make
- cultural practises and strongly held beliefs in the community
- family income reduction, role changes
- sleep deprivation
- confidence in parenting
- returning to walk/ child care

# Puerperal sepsis
- maternal temp >39 within 2 weeks of birth
- sources
    + endometritis
    + mastitis
    + c-section
- UTI (much more susceptible)
- VTE, URTI, surgical iv site, epidural site

# Endometritis
- excess vaginal bleeding >24 hrs after delivery @infection and retained products of conception (RPOC). esp @emergency C-section. also @more instrumentation
- present @fever, tachy, tender bulky uterus
- HVS (swab), US, blood cultures

# Post partum mood disorders
- postpartum blues @80% women 3-4 day post delivery. very common, resolves on its own.
- p/w mood swings, tearfulness, insomnia, loss concentration.
- reassure. (disctinct from PPD)

# Postpartum contraception
- contraception important to prevent early pregnancy. 
- first ovulation 8 weeks @no breastfeeding.
- @no breastfeeding == same as normal
- @breastfeeding alone
    + is 97% effective if no formula or solids or supplementary feeds, amenorrhoea, baby <6 months old
- breastfeeding + progesterone only
    + safe in breast feeding
- other options
    + condoms



# Questions
- lactose intolerance (does not develop until later so this is not a problem early for the baby)

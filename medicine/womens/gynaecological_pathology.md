###### Gynaecological pathology
    SIL and IN terminologies - learn these well

# Vulva pathology
- benign
    + dermatoses
        * dermatitis
        * lichen simplex chronicus
        * lichen sclerosus
            - precursor to invasive squamous carcinoma
        * lichen planus
    + cysts
    + benign neoplasia
    + condyloma acuminatum
        * @HPV, assoc with low risk subtypes (6 and 11 subtypes) -- covered @quadrivalent HPV vaccine
- malignant
    + squamous cell carcinoma (secondary to HSIL) -- on path see keratin pearls, desmoplastic stroma and intercellular bridges
    + vulval melanoma
    + extrammammary paget's disease




# HPV related terminology
- high grade SIL (squamous intraepithelial lesion)
    + thick epithelium, nuclear atypia with full thickness
- differentiated type (not HPV related) VIN (vulval)
    + basal nuclear atypia and epithelial thickening


# Vagina
- benign
    + cysts
    + leiomyoma (benign tumor)
- malingnat
    + squamous neoplasia (VAIN), either dysplasia or squamous cell carcinoma

# Cervix
- benign
    + cervical polyp (appear like skin tags, completely benign)
- squamous cell tumors/ precursor lesions
    + HPV infected and CIN1 (much more likely to regress) [LSIL]
        * HPV - little to no atypia, positive cervical cytology for HPV affected cells
        * CIN1 - basal region atypia
    + CIN2 and CIN3 much more likely to progress [HSIL]
        * CIN2 - 50% affected by atypia
        * CIN3 - up to full thickness atypia
- adenocarcinoma lesions
    + adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)
        * 95% assoc with oncogenic HPV types (18, 16, 45)
        * 5% @other causes


# Uterine body pathology
    normal epithlial and stromal components, changes with the hormonal cycle: phases of (proliferative, secretory, menstrual, postmenopausal). histology varies according to stage ==> exogenous progesterone/ estrogen causes changes in histol (inactive)
- Endometrium
    + benign
        * endometritis
            - acute
            - chronic: diagnosed @plasma cells in the stroma -- indication to send sample to microbiology 
        * polyp
        * adenmyosis (common, causes heavy bleeding but benign.)
    + endometrial hyperplasia
        * hyperplasia without atypia (low progression to carcinoma)
        * hyperplasia with atypia (high risk == risk of carcinoma development)
    + endometrial carcinoma
        * risk @estrogen exposure, obesity, smoking, lynch
        * type
            - endometrioid adenocarcinoma is the most common -- grade according to degree of solid growth 
            - others: mucinous, squamous, mixed, clear cell, serous
- Myometrium (uterine body)
    + smooth muscle tumors
        * leiomyoma "fibroids" (very common, benign condition)
        * smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malingant potential (%bad)
        * leiomyosarcoma (bad)
    + stromal tumors
        * endometrial stromal tumors
    + mixed tumors (mullerian)
        * adenosarcoma
        * carcinosarcoma

# Fallopian tube
- benign
    + paratubal cyst (fimbrial, very common and benign)
- malignant
    + STIC (serous tubal intraepithelial neoplasia)
    + adenocarcinoma
    + serous carcinoma

# Ovary
- non neoplastic
    + cyst 
        * functional cyst (follicular cysts, corpus luteum)
        * ovarian abscess
    + PCOS
        * 3-6% women of reproductive age w/ persistent anovulation == hirsutism, obseity, infertility, insulin resistance.
- malignant
    + epithelial tumors
    + mesenchymal 
    + sex cord stromal (tumors from hormone producing cells)
    + Germ cell tumors
    + Metastatic

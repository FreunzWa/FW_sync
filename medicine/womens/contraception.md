###### Contraception

# Methods
- condoms (female and male condom inserted @each use. female c is less available and more expensive)
- diaphragm (silicon flexible outer spring and dome of material, no longer available @australia. must stay in place after intercourse. lowest eefficacy figures for typical use. no decrease in STIs however.) used @combination with spermicide, can stay up for 24 hours.
- cervical cap: smaller version of diaphgram. as effective as diaphgram.
- vaginal sponge: coated with spermicide
- fertility awareness -- termperature
    + detect body temp rise that occurs post ovulation about 0.2-0.5 degrees, remaining high until next menstruation. intercourse omitted until 3 days after temperature increase
    + take temp before any food, first thing in morning
- mucus method
    + observation of vaginal mucus -- wait for dry and sticky rather than wet. omit intercourse for 3 days after fertile wet mucus period
- sympto-thermal
    + combination of the 2 above fertility awareness, note mucus change to herald ovulation, and temp and mucus change to indicate end.
- rhythm method
    + assess over 3 cycles == typical fertile range. recorrds shortest and longest, subtracts 21 days from shortest cycle and 10 from longest
- lactational amenorrhoea
    + while full breast feeding 98% effective, less than 6 months postpartum and no gap of more than 4 hours and 6 hours at night between feds..


# Emergency contraception (post coital contraception)
- EC back up method of contraception @UPSI. usu @slippage, breakage, missed OCP. is not abortion.
- options:
    + levonorgestrel PO 1.5mg
        * can get @pharmacy
        * one off P4
        * prevent or dedlay obulation by disrupting follicular development, will not work @already LH surge.
        * approved use up to 72 hours (3 days), but may have efficacy up to 96 hours (4 days). efficacy diminishes with time.
        * does not effect pregnancy nor cause ++ectopics
        * works @thicken cervical mucus and suppresses the LH surge == stops ovulation
        * counselling:
            - @vomiting within 2 hours, take another 1.5mg.
            - usu period around same time, but may delay by up to 1 week -- if not get PT
    + Yuzpe method
        * only @LNG-EC not available
        * combined E2 and P4 12 hours apart, +antiemetic
    + Non hormonal EC
        * copper containining IUD
        * interferes with sperm passage, inhibits fertilisation and implantation
        * dont insert @already viable pregnancy, so thus can ony insert up to day 12 of the cycle or 5 days after the first episode of UPSI


# Sterilisation

- female
    + risks: +=EP risk
    + laparoscopic occlusion
    + hysteroscopic occlusion (suggest interim alternative contraception for 12 weeks)
        * essure: insertion of nickel/ Ti rods
        * Adiana: silicone matrices inserted @each tube
- male
    + very effective, can be performed as outpatient. not intended for reversal but %microsurgery can restore.

# Abortion
    aka therapeutic abortion/ TOP
    as pregnancy matures, icnreasing requirement for surgical methods/ specialised training
    @STOP will require US, Hbg
    @MTOP require US
- T1 abortion (<13 weeks)
    + 90% of abortions carried out <12 weeks
    + MTOP
        * MS-2 step (++effective up to 8 weeks)
            - mifepristone
                + anti-progestational agent == primes uterus and cervix for actions of the the PG, reverses acceptance of fetal allograft
                + dose varies @GA
            - misoprostol
                + take MSP about 36-48 hours after.
                + PBS covered for up to 63 completed days gestation
                + abortion is complete in majority <8 hours of MSP
            - followup
                + bHCG, pelvic US. 
    + STOP (DVC)
        * DVC: dilation and vaccuum curettage
        * day stay procedure
        * performeed @local cervical Anaesthesia and sedation
        * misoprostol used as prelude to soften cervix to reduce blood loss and perforation risk
        * suction curettage
        * reduced Asherman syndrome vs other methods
        * no definitive lower GA limit, but @<7 weeks == care not to miss gestation sac
        * this method usu up to about 13 weeks, then reqeuire D&E
- T2 abortion (>13 weeks)
    + MTOP preferred
        * oral mifepristone followed by MSP 24-48 horus later then repeat MSP up to 5 doses
    + STOP (D&E)
        * after about 14 weeks vaccuum will not work @calcified fetal skeleton
        * D&E, requires ++cervical dilatation (up to 18mm), requires MSP or MFP to soften cervix 24 plus phours before. 
        * start: curette placed against fetal chest and suck == death instantly @fetal heart and thorax sucked out. surgical removal of remainder of limbs, need to check to ensure got everything to reduce bleeding risk.
        * uterus then massaged in order to ensure full contracted.
        * difficult to perform after 20 weeks @toughness of fetal tissuees.
        * cx
            - endometrtiis, RPOC, damage to uterus eg Asherman syndrome, infertility, psychological
- Late termination of pregnancy (>20 weeks, variable definitions)
    + late term considered 20-24 weeks in australia.
    + indicated @maternal health risk OR @fetal anomalies. (esp those with death soon after birth)
    + associated procedures (will depend on GA)
        * D&E
            - may be difficult @too late @toughness of fetal tissues
        * early labor induction
            - prematurely
        * intact dilation and extraction
            - rarer, use of digoxin or KCl to soften fetal bones then forcibly pull it out, crushing the skull
        * hysterotomy abortion
            - but high risk of side effects. usu cut umbilicus etc before delivery to ensure death on delivery.

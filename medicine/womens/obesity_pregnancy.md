###### Obesity and diabetes in pregnancy

# Complications and risks of increased BMI
    miscarriage
    NTDs
    GDM
    IUGR/ Macrosomia 
    Pre-Eclampsia and HTN
    Macrosomia
    Miscarriage/ FDIU
    Need for induction (high rate of post-dates)
    Failure to progress in labor (-=vol and freq of contractions)
    Shoulder dystocia
    C-section 
        infection
        lactation difficulties (also breasts may be too big)


# Considerationss prepregnancy
- treatments
    + weight loss prior to pregnancy
        * even small weight loss improves fertiliy and prengancy health
        * diet and exercise plan 
    + folate supplementation increased - 5mg daily
    + dietitian referral for diet planning, esp for anyone with complex nutritional requirements
    + bariatric surgery: improves fertility. -risk of GDM/ HTN but potentially higher risk of IUGR/ perinatal mortality. 

# Weight in pregnancy
    @overweight == assoc with HTN and GDM, but independent risk of obesity == ++negative outcomes. FGR/ macrosomia/ operative delivery. lower rate of successful analgesia/ IV access/ surgical difficulty for C-section
- weight gain
    + 40+BMI (gain <6.7 kg, sometimes no weight gain preferable)
    + 30-40 BMI (gain 5-9)
    + normal gain (~11kg, up to 16)
    + underweight gain <12-18
- excess weight gain == ++risk of obesity related outcomes
- additional energy required in pregnancy
    + MUCH less than the eating for 2
    + no additional requirement in the first 1/3
    + second TM - small increase eg. 2 serves of fruit, or small sandwich
    + third TM, above requireents in T2 + half cup of baked beans or one glass of low fat milk

# Models of care in obesity and diabetes
- @BMI 30-40, then obstetrician hospital based care
- Diabetes - requires
    + endocrinologist
    + dietician
    + obstetrician
    + diabetes educator

# Nutritional supplementation
- take folate 0.5 mg or high dose folate 5mg @risk factors for NTDs until get pregnant up until 12 weeks of pregnancy
- Iron:
    + @iron deficient, esp @iron deficiency anaemia == reuqires supplementation prior to pregnancy
    + @there are higher reqruiements for iron in pregnancy
- Vitamin D
    + adequate VitD requires sun epoxusre and diet.
    + high risk women screened early in prengancy and treated with VitD supplements @vitD @levels below 50

# Routine dietary advice in pregnancy
- dont eat too much fish: 
    + 2-3 serves salmon/ tuna in a week
    + flake, broadbill, marlin, swordfish no more than once per fortnight - no other fish
    + catfish no more than once per week - no other fish
- Listeria
    + v uncommon in ausralia
    + listeriosis assoc with FDIU, miscarriage, preterm birth
    + symptoms of headache, fever, fatigue, aches/ pains, %abdo pain, nausea, diarrhoea. symptoms may occur weeks after food is eaten


# Screening @elevated BMI
    key is the additional OGTT screen done at 16 weeks @increased risk of GDM
    and growth scan at 30-32 weeks
- 12 week nuchal scan
- 16 week OGTT
    + GDM screening
- 20 week morphology scan
- 28 week OGTT
- 30-32 week US growth

# Intrapartum considerations
- see an anaesthetist
    + delay in regional anaesthetisia
        * @distorted anatomy
        * longer needle required
        * increased risk of higher block (thoracic block @reverse trendelenberg == resp compromise and risk of death)

# Diabetes management
- BSLs
    + fasting + 2 hours post-prandials (as oppose to before, because the sugar peaks drive macrosomia)
    + insulin requirements increases linearly each week in pregnancy
    + targets
        * <5 for fasting
        * <6.7 for post-prandial
- IOL
    + induced at 38 weeks for increasing insulin requirements OR for falling insulin requirements (indicates placental failure)

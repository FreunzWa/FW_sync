###### IUGR
    failure of fetus to achieve growth potential
    SFD (small for dates)
    usu @PI == chronic hypoxia
    considered SGA @<10 percentile

# Significance
- short term
    + ++preterm labor, 
    + ++perinatal mortality, 
    + ++neonatal mortality
- long term
    + ++childhood long term morbidity
        * mostly affect motor cortex but some intellectual handicap (CP and mental retardation)
    + ++adulthood mortality and disease
        * BW inverse related to HTN, dyslipidaemia, vascular disease, diabetes. much earlier onset

# Etiology
- fetal 
    + congenital
        * chromosomal (T21, T13, T18, Monosomies: Turner's - XO, UPD - uniparental disomy).
            - uniparental disomy: 2 chr from one parent (eg Chr6. also assoc with recessive disorders)
            - maternal growth genes: take over to determine size of the fetus to allow for easier delivery
            - confined placental mocaicism (trisomy in the placenta == crappy placenta)
        * genetic
        * structural anomalies
            - Gastroschisis (25-70% have IUGR)
            - skeletal disease
        * familial
    + infection
        * IUGR
            - toxoplasmosis (stray cat litter, esp southern europe, they have strong screening) -- eliminate with antibiotics
            - CMV (carriers from children)
            - %syphilis/ %rubella
- maternal
    + vasclular disaeaes (hypertension, SLE, diabetes)
    + toxins 
    + thrombophilia (inherited hypercoagulation) == placental vessel thrombosis (placental vessels are already prone to thrombosis.)
        * acquired: APS, smoking, malignancy, pregnancy
        * congenital: protein S, C, antithrombin 3, F5L (5%), prothrombin gene mutation (2%), MTHFR (common, 20%)
    + cardiac disease
    + anaemia
    + ARH
- placental
    + multiple pregnancy
    + abruption
    + placenetal abnormalities

# Screening
- on exmination
    + symphyseal-fundal height (SFH) measurement
- ultrasound 
    + biometrics use in formula to determine size relative to population

# Prevention
- aspirin (improve blood flow through placenta)
- work and rest optimisation (maximise CO to the placenta)
- avoid vitamin E/ C as this worsens IUGR


# Management
- SFH
- confirm diagnosis 
    + ultrasound
    + rule out placental insufficiency: genetically small? (@normal umbilical and other doppler studies, parents are small)
- determine etiology
    + history/ examination (GI, HTN, vitals)
    + investigations (FBE, paired serology CMV IgG/IgM and toxoplasmosis, thrombophilia screen, genetic testing)
    + karotyping: 
        * important @
            - confirm lethal diagnosis and prognosticating
            - prepare neontal pall care
            - trisomy 18/13 will require vertical C-section
- fetal surveillance
- therapy
- delivery

- termination still allowed up until delivery
    + this is so that the mother can still terminate if there is severe disability in the fetus towards the end of pregnancy (eg @CMV infection -- wherein most fetuses with a CMV infection are not severely FGR, but 1/10 severe)
    + however there are not very many late trimester terminations at all.

- nitric oxide
- sildenafil 
    + recent research into dilating the placental vessel dilation. however blunder @sildenafil accustomed, pulmonary hypertension == death of the fetus aterbirth.
- hyperalimentation

###### Malpresentation and malposition
    @normal axial pressure within birth canal == atlanto occipital joint rotation == fully flexed vertex presentation @85% pregnancies == smallest possible diameters
- Attitude types
    + usu @OP position
    + Vertex in 85%
        * Suboccipito-bregmatic diameter: 9.5cm
    + Deflexed vertex in 15% "military/ anterior fontanelle"
        * usu present with posterior position
        * Occipito-frontal diameter: 11.5cm
        * high incidence of C-section delivery and instrumental deliveries @prolonged labors
    + Brow presentation: 1 in 500 pregnancies
        * supra-occipital mental diameter: 13.5 cm
        * most unfavorable of all deflexion attitudes
        * @13.5cm == usu prevents vaginal birth unless it flexes autonomously
        * can examine vaginally to see the anterior fontanelle/ use an USS
        * the baby will have a prominent brow after being birthed @vaginally
        * risk @low fetal tone == failiure to flex
        * management:
            - kielland forceps to manually rotate, but much more common is C-section
    + Face presentation (maximal extension): 1 in 800 pregnancies
        * suboccipitobregmatic diameter: 9.5cm
        * favorable attitude for birthing, usu @heightened extensor tone/ anterior tumor/ mass in the neck. %%anencephaly but usu  diagnosed early
        * USS
        * usually longer than normal labor. usu face bruised and blue, recovers quickly.
        * esp difficult in menotposterior position, anmd it will usu not correct in labor -- recommend a c section
- Presentation types
    + Posterior position
        * 60% posterior positions will rotate @descent through the pelvis.
        * management
            - @failurre to progress in second stage == 
                + manual rottation
                + instrumental rotation (Kielland forceps/ vaccuum)
                + instrumental delivery (face to pubis)
                + C-section
                + oxytocin augmentation
    + Occiptiaolateral position "Transverse"
        * is normal early in labor @pelvic inlet is wider (13.5 cm) than itss AP diameter (11 cm). @descent == the pelvic floor will rotate the head
        * usu @OP position that fails to rotate completely. this is easier to fix than an OP position.






# Breech
    97% cephalic presentation @term
- risk factors (change of shape of fetus and uterus)
    + fibroids/ malformations (eg bicornuate uterus)
    + polyhydramnios/ prematurity (rounder uterus)
    + placenta positioned inferiorly
    + hydrocephaly
    + grandmultiparous (@uterine laxity)
- hei
    + past history of baby breech
    + e: belottable fetal head high
- complications
    + cord prolapse @ROM because the head does not block the cervix (in breech the liquor escapes around the leg)
- investigations
    + hip dislocation congenitally @US prior to deliery
- management
    + @present before  @36 weeks == often wait for baby to invert (4% have breech at 36 weeks)
    + @still breech @37 weeks
    + ECV: external cephalic version done from 36-37 weeks, earlier pointless @high chance of spontaneous version. more difficult @fetal leg extension or nulliparous
        * Risks: feto-maternal hemorrhage, placental abruption, cord entanglement -- so give RhD
        * CIs: @already plan elective CS, antepartum hemorrhage, oligohydramnios, uterine scar, multiple pregnancy
        * can give terbutaline to soften uterus. 
        * CTG before and afterwards
    + elective CS 39-40 weeks
    + planned vaginal breech birth (%@multiparous)
        * negative outcome predictive facotrs
            - large fetus (3.8 kg+), small fetus (@preterm), placental insufficiency, fetal head extension, footling breech, evidence of cephalopelbic disproportion
        * First stage
            - NPO @requirement for emergency surgery
            - exclude cord prolapse as soon as waters break
        * Second stage
            - lithotomy position
            - routine episiotomy @tight perineum
        * maneurvres
            - burns-marshall method (swing feet upwards)
        * complications
            - failure to deliver head (fetal hypoxia)


# Transverse lie
    no mechanism for delivery, must either be corrected or CS.
    1 in 200 @37 weeks GA
- rf
    + similar to breech, but ++@multiparity (@hypotonus of the uterus and anterior abdominal wall).
    + placenta location esp placenta praevia
- hei
    + can see transverse on inspection of abdomen @lateral expansion.
    + no fetal pole palpable @the fundus or the lower uterus
    + US confirmation, must also look for placenta praevia esp @not multiparous
- rx
    + ECV, but ++revert to transvere
    + @>38 weeks present == admit to hospital for monitoring until lie corrects or CS @PROM (high mortality if not at hospital). can DC @lie stable for 48 hours
    + CS difficult @poorly developed lower part of uterus == difficult to grab presenting part, can vert the baby @sufficient liquor fairly easily.
- complicatrions
    + cord prolapse and fetal death

###### Failure to progress in labor (labor dystocia)

# Labor dystocia
    aka slow progress in labor 
    3P's: causes @powers (uterine), @passenger (fetus), passages (birth canal)
    most common @large fetus in posterior position in small woman
- the powers
    + normal pattern: fundal dominant contractions, synchronisation of spread of excitation wave, prgoressive increase in amplitude, relaxation between contractions
    + uterine muscle dysfunction
        * hypotonic (infrequent/ weak)
        * incoordinated synchronisation wave
    + uterine inertia (infrequent, incoordinated contractions, abnormal throughout labor)
        * %@uterine overdistention and lack of well-fitting presenting part
    + uterine exhaustion    
- the passage
    + boney pelvis shape (android, spina bifidia, untreated congenital dislocation of the hip, rickets, severe pelvic trauma past history)
    + soft tissue (uterine fibromyoma @cervix lower uterine segment, ovarian mass, vaginal septum)
- the passenger
    + fetal macrosomia/ fetal attitude problems (presentation of large diameters eg @brow/ deflexed presentation)

# Obstructed labor
    directly @presenting part cannot negotatie teh pelvis (cephalopelvic disproportion)
- medical
    + complications (2 main types) @no obstetric support
        * obstructed labor == sepsis, fetal death, genital tract fistula
            - more common @primigravid. fetal head == ischaemic necrosis of soft tissues == infected == fetal death == fetal skull collapse == past vaginally == obstetric genital tract fistula (vesicovaginal most common)
        * obstructed labor == uterine rupture, maternal death, fetal death
            - more common @multigravida. presenting part forced against pelvis and uterus continues to contract powerfully == lower segment rupture == fetus into maternal abdomen == maternal exsanguination. both die
    + maternal
        * CA
        * PPH (uterine exhausation)
        * uterine rupture
        * vesicovaginal fistula
    + fetal
        * fetal infection
        * trauma (extensive moulding)
        * fetal hypoxia
- clinical 
    + features
        * lack of progress (Cervical dilation, station lower, contractions)
        * maternal/ fetal tachy
        * maternal pyrexia
        * macroscopic hematuria
        * retraction ring on abdo examination
        * cervical edema
        * caput 
        * moulding
- treatment
    + augmentation of labor with oxytocin infusion

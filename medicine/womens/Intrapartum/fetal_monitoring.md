# CTG monitoring "EFM"
    used @neonate >28 weeks. highly sensitive but poorly specific to unwell fetus @individual fetal responses to hypoxia
- baseline FHR
    + measure of FHR when stable at baseline (not acceleration or deceleration). determined over time period of 5-10 mins
    + @preterm == higher baseline
    + fetal tachycardia (>160)
        * %@fetal hypoxia/ CA/ hyperthyroidism/ fetal anaemia
    + fetal bradycardia (<100)
        * cord prolapse/ compression
        * epidural/ spinal anaesthesia
        * rapid fetal descent
- baseline variability
    + minor fluctuation @basline FHR. the difference betwen the peak OR trough from baseline FHR in one minute of trace
        * increased >25
        * normal: 6-25
        * reduced: 3-5
        * absent: <3
    + can be okay @absent-reduced <40 minutes @sleep wake cycle (baby sleep lasts for 40 minutes)
- accelerations
    + transient increase of FHR or more above baseline lasting >15 seconds. 
    + @preterm == typically lesser amplitude and shorter duration
    + normal is 2 in 20 minutes
    + can be normal to have absent accelerations
- decelerations
    + tranisent decreased FHR below baseline >15 lasting >15 seconds. 
    + sometimes late decels may be less than 15 bpm from baseline
    + types
        * early
            - benign. assoc @sleep cycle, caused @head compression == ++ICP == vagal reflex == -=HR
            - start and finish with the contraction.
            - appear to mirror contraction
        * variable
            - repetitive/ intermittent decreased of FHR with rapid onset and recovery. 
            - most commonly simultaneous with contractions but %not correlated
            - complicated variable decels
                + when variables are combined with other signs of fetal hypoxia.
        * prolonged
            - decreased FHR below basline >15 bpm for longer than 90 seconds, <5 mins
        * late
            - uniform repetitive decresing of FHR w/ slow onset starting mid-end of contraction and nadir more than 20 secs after peak of contraction, ending after contraction finished
            - caused @contractions with pre-existing hypoxia
- sinusoidal pattern
    + oscillating pattern, smooth regular. cycles 2-5 per minute. usu amplitude 5-15 bpm. 
    + usu @severe anaemia w/ Hgb <50. 
    + baseline variability absent with no accleerations
- pseudosinusoidal pattern
    + not associated iwth fetal compromise
    + looks sinusoidal but with assoc baseline variablity and %accelerations
- contractions
    + frequency (n in 10 minutes)
    + duration (how long does each last for)

# Feature recognition
- significant compromise features, may require urgent delivery
    + prolonged brady (100bpm FOR >5 minutes)
    + prolonged tachy >170 bpm 
    + absent baseline variability <3 bpm
    + complicated variable decels w/ reduced variability
    + late decels w/ reduced/ absent variability
- concerning features on CTG
    + baseline tachy >160
    + complicated variable decels
    + late decels
    + reduced baseline variability 3-5
    + prolonged decelerations
    + rising baseline/ fetal tachy
    + onset of nadir after peak of contraction
    + slow return to baseline FHR after end of contraction
    + loss o fpre and post deceleration shouldering
- reassuring features
    + good baseline variability
    + early/ typical variable decelerations
    + regular accelerations
    + shouldering around decelerations
- unlikely to be assoc with fetal compromise when occurring isolation
    + baseline FHR 100-110
    + absence of accel
    + early decels
    + variable decels w/  no complicating features


# Differentials for concerning CTG
- cord compression/ decreased umbilical blood flow
    + change maternal position (left lateral position)
    + check the blood pressure
    + give 500 bolus crystalloid if hypotensive
    + VE to exlclude cord prolapse
- inadequate quality CTG
    + poor contact? fetal scalp electrode not working or detached?
- uterine hyperstimulation
    + stop/ reduce oxytocin infusion 
    + @severe == emergency tocolysis
- maternal tachy/ fever
    + check BP == crystalloid @low
    + maternal infection?
    + maternal dehydration?
    + obstructed labor? 

# Urgent followup
- consider FBS (scalp fetal blood sampling)
    + lactate levels
        * <4 == repeat in 1 hr
        * 4-4.7 == repeat in 30 mins or expedite delivery
        * 4.7+ == code green == emergency CS
    + @>9 mins bradycardia == emergency CS

       
# FBS - lactate
- contraindications
    + cervix <3 cm
    + maternal HepB/ C/ HIV/ ITP

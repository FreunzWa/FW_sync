###### Fetal movements
    very important clinical tool in the 3rd trimester from 26 weeks onwards to assess fetal wellbeing @most stillbirths assoc with days-hours of DFMs.
    rate FMs highly variable, but a guide is 

# Normal
- properly felt at 17 weeks in multigravid, 19 weeks @first baby. (@anterior location == later feel movements). rough guide is 17-20 weeks.
- may be first felt 13-16 weeks as 'quickening' (felt as a flutter)


# Advice on FMs
- checking
    + checking with meals
    + count to 10 each day for n. movements only recommend @research usu
    + usual pattern (get used to normal pattern)
- provoking activity
    + cold sweet drink, gently prodding (and learn how the fetus usu responds)
- sleep periods:
    + advise that fetus sleeps for up to 40 minutes, occuring throughout day and night == absent movements.
    + sleep / wake cycles are usu 90 minutes.
- encourage to present @decreased FMs/ ring hospital


# Approach to assessment
- H
    + duration/ pattern of DFM vs. normal, how long since last felt baby move. previous history of DFMs
    + maternal lifestyle issues (exercise/ smoking) 
    + medications
    + abdominal pain, bleeding
    + risk factors for stillbirth (hypertension, GDM, IUGR, congenital malformation, poor obs hisotry)
- E
    + vitals
    + urinalysis
    + conscious state
    + abdominal: fundal height appropriate for GA, fetal life + presentation, palpated movements, contractions, tension/ guarding
- I
    + CTG and FHR
    + even @normal CTG, if perception of DFM persists == do an US for fluid and biometry. 

# Causes of DFM
- physiological
- maternal perception
    + stressful, not focussing on FMs
    + anxious, focusses on the periods in which no FMs
- structural    
    + -=amniotic fluid volume
    + fetal position
    + anterior placenta
    + smoking
    + overweight
    + nulliparity
- acute causes of fetal compromise
    + vasa praevia bleed
    + placental abruption
    + placenta praevia
    + trauma
    + infection (CA)
- chronic causes of fetal compromise
    + fetal anaemia
    + FGR/ placental insufficiency
    + chromosomal abnormalities
    + hypertension, diabetes


# Management/ Investigation
- DFMs<28 weeks:
    + confirm FHB with doppler device
    + not felt FMs by 24 weeks == can refer for specialist assessment
- DFMs >28 weeks
    + go to hospital for assessment within 2 hours of DFMs
    + dont drink iced water/ eat something to try and get to move. dont rest and monitor movements, just come in immediately.

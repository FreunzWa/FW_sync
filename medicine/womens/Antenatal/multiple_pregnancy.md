###### Multiple pregnancy
    twins: risk is pretty much doubled for everything in relation to pregnancy. in some areas even higher (eg prematurity is 6x more likely.)
    most important is to determine chorionicity to predict outcomes and manage.
    chorionicity very important to determine @monochorionic ==  much greater risk of of complications. all monochorionic twins are MZ
    1.7% of pregnancies in Australia are multiple, 97% of these are twins.
- classification
    + zygosity:
        * 2/3 are dizygotic (independent fertilisation of 2 ovulated oocytes). always dichorionic.
        * 1/3 are monozygotic (cleavage of single fertilised oocyte)
    + chorionicity / amnionicity -- key determiner of outcome.
        * dichorionic diamnotic: very early cleavage <4 days post fert. 1/3 of MZ twins. separate placenta, separate sacs.
        * monochorionic diamenotic: cleavage of MZ pregnancy btwen 4-8 days post fert. shared placenta with separate sacs. most common, approx 2/3 of MZ twins
        * monochorionic monoamniotic: cleavage 8-12 post fert. 1% of MZs. 
        * conjoined: @cleavage of MZ pregnancy after day 12. +++rare. 
- epid
    + rf
        * increasing parity, increase maternal age, use of reproductive technologies (IVF)
        * dizygotic twins have ethnicity bias (eg low in Japan, hiher in africa). this is not seen with MZ twins
        * IVF specifically increases the incidence of dizygotic twins
- investigations
    + USS diagnose twins, and determine amnionicity, chorionicity. 
- rx
    + early pregnancy:
        * ++nausea and vomiting, fatigue, nutritional requirements increase. increased iron, foltae and clacilum supplemented. advise about increased risk for HEGs
        * morphology scan at a centre more experienced iin dealing with twins.
        * inmcreaased weeight gain requirementts.
        * GDM sccreening as normal unless otherwise indicated.
        * finish work sooner
        * incrased risk of DS == ultrasound to diagnose specific, then proceed to tissue diagfnosis.
    + termination
        * selective termination si possible in dichorionic with K+ cardiac injection. however this selective termination dramatically incresasaes risk of spontaneous pregnnacy risk 
        * however in some cases the abn can compromise other fetus eg in anencephaly which causes polyhydramnios == high risk of preterm labor and delivery
    + growth monitoring
        * common in twins FGR, fetal biometry. ongoing scans.
        * it is normal to have good growth for both until the 3rd trimiester at which poitnt he growth slows.
        * growth discordance:
            - 
    + increased symptmos associated with prengnacy
- complications of multiple pregnancy
    + antenatal: ++emesis, muscle ache, pressure symptoms worse, preeclampsia, GDM, APH
        * ++risk of preterm birth is no1 cause of perinatal morbidity. before 32 weeks risk 10%, before 37 weeks about 60%. avg age of gestation is 35 weeks for twins, 32 weeks for triplets.
        * important to screen for causes of preterm birth (eg cervical insufficiency), treat asymptomatic bactiuria, stop smoking. 
    + intrapartum: PPH
    + fetal complications: ++risk of congenital malformations, FGR, premature birth, complciations with delivery

# Complications of multiple pregnancy
- maternal
    + Antenatal:
        * symptomatic: ++reflux, back pain, N/V, HEG higher rate, breast tenderness
        * T1: HEG, threatened abortion, miscarriage, increased fetal abnormalities
        * T2/T3: anaemia, CI, GDM, PET, PPROM, HTN, polyhydramnios (TTTS), social, APH, IUGR, premature delivery, perinatal death/ morbidity, placental abruption
    + Intrapartum
        * Malpresentation
        * PPROM
        * Preterm labor
        * Failure to progress
        * Poor contraction
        * increased risk of trauma
        * placental abruption (@delivery of 1st twin usu)
    + Postpartum
        * increased PPH risk (atony/ uterine exhaustion)
        * -=breast feeding for both 
        * difficult to look after both at once
        * ++risk of PTNDepression

# Monochorionic twins
- monitoring
    + should be monitored every 2-3 weeks from 12 weeks to determine TTTS presence.
- additional complications of a single placenta
- TTS (twin to twin transfusion syndrome)
    + @unbalanced vascular communications == donor twin becomes hypovaolaemia, hypotensive, anuric == anyhydramnios. the recipient twins = polyhydramnios and hgh output cardiac failure. 
    + usually fatal for both @not terated
    + treated @fetoscopic lazer photocoagulation fot eh placental vessels. 
- death of one twin
    + @anastomoses that run between == death of one twin causes hypotensive shock to the other fetus and liikely deaeth.
- cord entanglement 
    + during deliivery much more common == fetal hypoxia riks.

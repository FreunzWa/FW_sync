###### Infectious diseases in pregnancy

# Infection @pregnancy by site
    Reproductive tract
    UTI
    Breast
    %skin infections post delivery
- sites of infection
    + 4 sites: uterus, perineal/ abdo wounds, Urinary tract, breast. (infection @mother)
- reproductive tract
    + Choroamnionitis: infection of fetus/ seecundines/ AF @ascending infection @vagina usu @colonised. (mix of anaeoribc/ aerobic). ++@PPROM (esp with cervical suture), or @maternal --> fetal spread @placenta (eg @listeriosis). CTG == fetal tachy, maternal fever etc, CRP, %%amniocentesis for diag (but @oligohydramnios @PPROM). 
        * Rx: treat @erythromycin proph @PPROM. @established CA == amoxycillin, gentamicin, metroidazole. Expedite delivery
    + postpartum endometritis: @++GBS, coliforms, anaerobes (classicaly GAS @hand washing incident) == spread to placenta site == parametritis/ pelvic peritonitis %sepsis. risk @++VEs, RPOC, %CS.
        * Rx @BSAs
    + postabortal endometritis
        * risk @RPOC
- urinary tract
    + cystitis
        * @pH/ amino acids/ sugar + smooth muscle relax @P4 == obstruction == ++bacterial growth @pregnant women urine. 
        * ++coliform, GNs, %GBS (++risk of GBS colonosiation of neonate), %mycoplasma, ureaplasma
        * 6% bactiuria in early pregnancy @MSU (includes asymp) == 1/3 get pyelnephritis == morbidity/ perinatal mortality.
        * ++use NF, amoxicilliin, cephalexin, Augmentin (5 days), retest MSU after 1 week. @recur == suppression @NF throughout pregnancy + investigate @renal tract US
    + pyelonephritis
        * UTI + fever + loin pain. 20% bacteraemia/ sepsis. 
        * ix @MSU, FBE, renal function, blood cultures
        * ampicillin + gentamicin IV for 24 hours, then PO for 10 days. proof of cure MSU after.
        * @++recurs, ++require NF suppression therapy for pregnancy at night.
- breast infection
    + @stagnation of milk @blocked duct == bacterial overgrowth, ++@staph aureus from the baby (often resistant @HA)
    + one quadrant localised pain and redness + general infection symptoms
    + BSAs needed to prevent abscess (aspiration with US, or requires open drainage). PO Diclox, or IV fluclox @systemically unwell. 
    + confirm abscess @US
    + NSAIDs and cold compress for pain, empty the breast @continue breastfeeding

# Specific infections
    Syphilis
    Listeriosis
    Chlamydia
    GBS
    myoplasma, ureaplasma
- GBS
    + present 20% vaginal tracts some time of pregnancy. 50% babies born colonised == 1% serious GBS disease (1/1000 @untreated)
    + increase risk of PPROM / premature labor/ postpartum endometritis, pueperal sepsis, neonatal infecetion
    + neonatal infection
        * early onset sepsis (%meningitiss/ pneumonia, %life threatening)
        * late onset sepsis (1st week of life, baby lethargic and jaundice, %meningitis)
    + prevention
        * @LVS/ anorectal swab for GBS @36 weeks, benzylpencillin best proph, @allergy == cephazolin (clinda @severe, but 20% resistant) 
- Myocplasma/ ureaplasma
    + common colonisation of the genital tract, association with CA, preterm labor, puerpal/ neonatal infection. 
    + not clear if treating @asymptomatic women helps 
    + clindamycin or clarithromycin/ erythromycin


# Intrapartum prophylaxis for GBS colonisation
- indications
    + previous infant with GBS infection neonatal
    + postivee GBS screening culture
    + unknown GBS status at onset of labor with any of the following
        * delivery <37 weeks
        * amniotic membrane rupture > 18 hours
        * intrapartum temp >38 dedg
        * NAAT positive for GBS
    + GBS bactiuria in current pregnancy
- not indicated just because of:
    + colonisation with GBS @previous pregnancy
    + GBS bactiuria in prev pregnancy
    + negative GBS screening regardless of other risk factors
    + CS performed with intact membranes 



# GBS pregnancy
+ GPC, colonises lower GI and genital regions. 
+ in pregnancy, freqeunt cause of asymptomatic bacturia, UTI, upper genital tract infection, postpartum endometritisi, pneumonia, puerperal sepsis. 
+ colonisation is a risk for neonatal infection.
+ asymptomatic bacturia (caused by GBS or other) is a risk for low birth weight/ pre-term delivery

# Prevention
- primary prevention
    + dietary advice and listeria advice
    + vaccination (during pregnancy, pretussis and influencza)
- secondary prevention
    + screening for subcliical infection to prevent complications (asymptomatic bactiuria, GBS)
    + screening to prevent mother to child transmission
- tertiary prevention


# Indications for Antibiotics
- antenatal
- intrapartum
- post-partum: @chills, foul smelling discharge
- baby: signs of sepsis (resp distress, not repsonding, low or high temp)
- pre-discharge: @febrile, baby need to?

# Maternal obstetric infection
- chorioamniotitis
    + infection @chorion (meaty bit of placenta), and the covery of the cord, amnion. 
    + most common @polymicrobial ascending infection of enteric and vaginal flora esp @rupture membranes. (important to keep close eye on rupture membranes @++risk of infection). %haematogenous spread (listeria is very serious)
    + %subclinical chorioamnionitis 
    + complications
        * can cause endometritis post-delivery
        * spontaneous preterm labor
        * dysfunctional labor
        * PPH
        * sepsis @wound infection after hemorrhage, also fetal sepsis
        * DVT
    + risk factors
        * prolonged labor (@++examinations)
        * multiple vaginal examinations
        * prolonged rupture membranes (>24 hrs before term leabor)
        * preterm prelabor rupture of membranes
        * spontaneous preterm labor
        * cervical insufficiency (@++lax cervix "insufficient" due to effacement in first phase of labor)
        * known genital tract pathogens
    + presumptive diagnosis
        * @fever + 
            - fetal tachy
            - maternal leucko
            - purluent amniotic fluid
            - maternal tachy
            - uterine tenderness
        * definitive
            - Gram stain/ culture of amniotic fluid, histological infection
    + management
        * antibiotics
            - ceftriaxone, ampicillin (gentamicin not used @ototoxic to fetus)
        * delivery
            - labor induction
            - CS @other indications for CS
            - placental histology and culture
- maternal sepsis (puerperal sepsis)
    + GAS (most common), %GBS/ aureus
    + risk factors:
        * C-section
        * traumatic delivery
        * frequent vaginal examinations
        * retained placental products
    + management
        * BSAs, culturing from endocervical swabs
        * admission, fluid resus, IV antibiotics
- Urinary tract infections 
    + common @immunosuppressed state, asymptomatic bactiuria in 2-7% of pregnant owmen. %%==pylelonephritis == associated with sepsis and preterm birth
- GBS
    + 1/1000 births
    + intrapartum Abx prophylaxis reduces the EOGBS by 84%

# Fetal perinatal infections
    vertical transmission (intrauterine, intrapartum, post-partum)
    horizontal transmission (postpartum exposure to other family members)
- TORCH infections (PZS)
    + toxo
    + rubella
    + CMV
    + HSV
    + Parvovirus
    + Zika virus
    + Syphilis
- transplacental infection can cause growth restriction
- Rubella
    + uncommon @vaccinations, mild maternal illness but ++teratogen == heart defects/ cataracts/ deagness/ stillbirth
    + screening initially antenatal. 
    + rubella vaccine postpartum. 
    + generally advise avoid a live vaccine
- Syphilis
    + fetal hydrops (heart failure)
    + routine screening (16 weeks, 28 weeks? still debating about whether to commence a second screening). treat with penicillin (desensitisation necessary)
- Varicella
    + VZV IgG
    + @exposure == test VZV IgG (if negative, then give VZV IgG). severe maternal infection.
- CMV
    + 40% are negative seronegative, 1-2% seroconvert in pregnancy
    + leading cause of neurodevelopmental delay
    + CMV higher risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, severe end or organ disease
    + esp important for women with young children
    + 24 weeks, test seroconversion
    + fetal infection: PCR of amniotic fluid 
    + earlier infections are worse
    + vaccine is not yet effective. 
    + education reduces servoconversion (assume <3yrs are infected, thoroughly wash hands)
    + routine screening is not recommended
- HepB
    + 350m chronic carriers are global, most common transmitted intrapartumm. 90% newborns == chronic HBV which cannot clear @low initial response to infection. (thus ++risk of cirrhosis and HCC)
    + all should be screened, all should be vaccinated
    + antenatal tenofovir started 28-32 weeks depending @viral load, then all receive passive and active immunisation at birth.
- HIV
    + screen all during pregnancy
    + risk of transmission 27% during pregnancy.
    + interventions: ++HAART during pregnancy to prevent transmission. 
    + @high income
        * C-section @detectable viral load
        * advise formula feeding 
- HepC
    + screen all during pregnancy 
- HSV
    + not routinely screened


# Routine screening in pregnancy
- GBS
- serological screening for rubella, syphilis and varicella
- selected screening @high risk groups
- HepB/C/HIV

# Routine antenatal advice
- avoid listeria (sandwich meats, prepared salads, soft cheeses), toxoplasmosis (undercooked, dirty cat litter), salmonella (raw eggs)

###### Intrapartum period
- normal birth: between 37-42 weeks in vertex position, spontaneous in onset and low risk
- 

# Physiology of pregnancy
- increased herat rate, cardiac output, BP, physiological anaemia of pregnancy, +++GE reflux


# Structure of Intrapartum care
- Stages of labor (Categories)
    + First Stage (labor until cervix fully dilated)
        * labor? 
            - painful uterine contractions 
                + dilatation of the cervix (effaced) OR ruptured membranes OR small blood loss "show"
        * diagnose labor
            - examination
                + fetal membranes (ruptured/ intact?)
                + note presence of meconium stained amniotic fluid
                + abdominal palpation, vaginal examination
        * management
            - assessment of the mother (4 hourly urine test, hourly vitals)
            - fetal surveillance
            - assessment of progress
            - food + fluids
            - Abx
                + GBS screening (20% women have, 1/200 == fetal infection == 1/5 death of fetus). screen @low vaginal/ anal swab @36 weeks gestation.
            - pain relief
                + non pharmalogical (support person, birth environment, water immersion, relaxation and breathing, music analgesia, intradermal water blocks, TENS - low voltage skin impulses paravertebrally)
                + pharmalogical (nitrous oxide, narcotic analgesia, regional analgesia - epidural/ spinal/CSE)
    + Second Stage (cervix fully dilated until birth of baby)
    + Third Stage (from birth of baby until delivery of the placenta and membranes)




# Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS)
- resp distress @meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF), from mild to severe. 
- medical
    + mx
        * intrauterine passage of meconium, aspiration and resp disease == acidosis and hypoxaemia. 
        * despite asterile @enter the lungs == stimulate cytokine release == local inflamm/ cardiorespiratory dysfunction
        * has been found in the lungs of some stillborn infants
        * surfactant function decreased/ decreased production == further hypoxaemia
    + meconium physiology
        * meconium is thick black/green odorless material first appears @3rd month of gestation. (results @desquamation of GI, fatty material, amniotic fluid, protien, lipid, bile)
        * @anal sphincter innervation == decreasd passage by 20 weeks. usu pass meconium post birth. %pass meconium before birth @hypoxia/ umbilical cord compression
        * 
    + cx
        * resp disease/ failure/ acidosis
- clinical
    + risk factors: breech position, black/ south asians, increasing gestational age (++@postmature baby)
    + presentation
        * history of MSAF or evidence of meconium staining on PE of hte infant (vernix stained with M), nails stained
        * often small for gestational age/ postmature, decreased vernix
        *

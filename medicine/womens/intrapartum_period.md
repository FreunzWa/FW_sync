###### Intrapartum period
- normal birth: between 37-42 weeks in vertex position, spontaneous in onset and low risk
- 

# Physiology of pregnancy
- increased herat rate, cardiac output, BP, physiological anaemia of pregnancy, +++GE reflux


# Assessment
- history, labor history, antenatal education, analgesia
- examination: pre-eclampsia, uterine palpation
- fetal urine (same as amniotic fluid). note the colour and volume of amnitoic fluid. 
- fetal heart rate (reflects fetal gas exchange)
- CTG (cardiotocography): cardiac and uterine contraction measurement. continuous CTG needed @various diseases (eg DM)

# Ongoing assessment of labor
- uterine contraction 
- vaginal examination (description of baby position, station) every 4 hours on partogram. partogram used to determine when to refer to high level care.



# Structure of Intrapartum care
    really only know labor @has delivered the baby
- Stages of labor (Categories)
    + First Stage 'S1' (labor until cervix fully dilated)
        * labor? 
            - variable length (determined @parity and latent phase duration). 6-18 hrs nulliparous, otherwise 2019 hrs
            - painful uterine contractions 
                + dilatation of the cervix (effaced) OR ruptured membranes OR small blood loss aka "show"
        * diagnose labor
            - examination
                + fetal membranes (ruptured/ intact?)
                + note presence of meconium stained amniotic fluid
                + abdominal palpation (longitudinal vs. cephalic vs. station), vaginal examination (determine diltation of cervix, confirm cephalic and station)
                + station: head in relation to the midpelvis (the ischial spines)
                    * baby's head divided into 5 parts (each approx 2 cm), determines station
                    * the number of 5ths of the baby is in the pelvis.
                    * when the baby is 4/5 in the pelvis, at level of ischial spines "cephalic engagement"
        * management (6 things)
            - assessment of the mother (4 hourly urine test, hourly vitals)
            - fetal surveillance
                + CTG monitoring, intermittent auscultation
            - assessment of progress
                + abdominal palpation hourly
                + vaginal examination 4 hrly.
            - food + fluids
            - Abx
                + GBS screening (20% women have, 1/200 == fetal infection == 1/5 death of fetus). screen @low vaginal/ perianal swab @36 weeks gestation. == intrapartum penicillin with loading dose then four hour IV (clinda/ erythromycin @allergy)
                + prolonged rupture membranes
                + suspected chorio-amnionitis
                + endocarditis prophylaxis (esp a cogenital heart disease)
            - pain relief
                + most pain @cervical stretching (in 1st stage)
                + non pharmalogical (support person, birth environment, water immersion, relaxation and breathing, music analgesia, intradermal water blocks, TENS - low voltage skin impulses paravertebrally)
                + pharmalogical (nitrous oxide given 1:1 but doesnt work well, narcotic analgesia -- better short acting morphine/ fentanyl, regional analgesia - epidural/ spinal/CSE)
                    * epidural space, high volume, able to continuous infuse
                    * spinal: subarachnoid space, very effective, low volume
                    * want to block T10-L1 (uterus and plevic viscera), and the pernineum (S3,4,5), but the lower limbs are in between
                    * %perineal infiltration, pudendal nerve block
                    * lidocaine, bupivicaine, ropivacaine +/- opioid (fentanyl), +/-adrenaline
                    * side effects:
                        - hypotension (blocked sympathetic outflow), sympathomimetic (ephidrine, aramine "nmetaraminol") +crystalloid saline. hypotension is serious @fetal supply cutoff to save mother
                        - total spinal block (resp suppression, use adrenaline to get effect on the heart, more beta activity than norad)
                        - early postpartum
                            + pruritis, lower backache, urinaryretention, dural puncture headache (CSF leaks in hole in dura), spinal haematoma
                        - late side effects
                            + paralysis (very rare) 
                    * contraindications
                        - infection @site
                        - allergy
                        - coagulatopathy
                        - sepsis
            - anti-emetic
                + metoclopramide (watch OGS -- benztropine)
            - respiratory depression  
                + naloxone (@opioid overdose), but need 4 hour monitoring after naloxone for apnoea monitoring
    + Second Stage (cervix fully dilated until birth of baby)
        * starts with urge to push (urge to defecate?), vomit (quite common 1/10)
        * duration ~2-3 hours (slightly longer than epidural)
        * physiology
            - changes shape/ size (through flexion allows most favorable diameter to present to pelvis -- 9.5cm)/ position (Rotates to OA)
                + deflexed "military" @11cm (often too tight)
                + flexed (9.5 cm)
                + brow first (13.5 -- impossible)
                + nose/face first (9.5cm, but very rare)
                + traverse - 9.5cm
            - baby needs to go through curve of caras from the inlet, midposition (ischial spines) outlet. 
                + inlet, widest transverse
                + midposition is widest AP
        * 5 steps of head exiting the pelvis
            - restitution
        * management
            - maternal wellbeing
            - ausculation of the fetal heart/ colour of amniotic fluid
    + Third Stage (from birth of baby until delivery of the placenta and membranes)
        * usually 5-10 mins, %up to 1 hr.
        * signs of separation
            - fresh show of blood, lengthening of umbilical, uterus becomes firm. 
        * give oxytocic to prevent relxation of the uterus causing PPH (ergometrine, syntocinon, synto-metrine)
        * check for perineal lacerations +/- repair episiotomy else risk fistula formation
            - 1st-4th degree tear
                + 1st: just perineal skin
                + 2nd: muscle involved
                + 3rd: involve anal sphincter
                + 4th: involve rectal mucosa

### Physiology

# Terms
- cervical effacement
    + cervical length (approx 4 cm), however @decreasing station == shorter (effacement) == very thin mm cervix
- Labor stages
    + 1st: cervical effacement until fully dilated
    + 2nd: starts full dilatation of cervix until birth
    + 3rd: ends with delivery of the placenta (v important)
- spurious labor
    + uterine contractions, but not actual labor. usu @infection/ bleeding thus require further investigations
- rupture of the membrane
    + usu in 1st stage (%in 2nd stage)
    + the fused choroin and amnion
    + either @
        * spontaneous
            - 
        * artificial
            - usu amni-hook by med practitioner (may speed up labor, or can induce labor)
- contractions
    + efface and dilate the cervix == push fetus through.
    + usu timed @4 contractions every 10 minutes

# Components of birth
- power
- passenger
    + fetal attributes
        * lie (axis of baby rel to mother): longitudinal/ transverse/ oblique
        * presentation (part of baby closest to pelvis): cephalic presentation, %breech
        * attitude
            - degree of flexion/ extension. best is total neck flexion, flexion of limbs
        * position
            - occipito-anterior position: easier to flex
- passage
    + birth canal, boney pelvis


# Intrapartum monitoring
- limits iatrogenic pre-term birth
- stress hormones of labor promote clearance ofl ung fluids by opening H20 and ion channels == -=wet lungs (aka transient tachypnoea of the newborn)
- labor %%hazardous for the fetus == best is to monitor.
- risk of death highest day born (up until 92 yrs old)
- fetal wellbeing
    + ausculatation of fetal heath
        * every 15 minutes in active phase of S1, after every contraction in S2
    + amount and colour of amniotic fluid (fetal urine assessment)



# Birth effects on women
- postivie
    + natural high @endorphins (feel achievement -- %feel ecstatic)
    + predicts future births (shorter seconds labor)
    + reduces current and future problems related to uterine
- negative
    + worst pain of life (intermittent)
    + pelvic floor damage and other genital tract damage







# Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS)
- resp distress @meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF), from mild to severe. 
- medical
    + mx
        * intrauterine passage of meconium, aspiration and resp disease == acidosis and hypoxaemia. 
        * despite asterile @enter the lungs == stimulate cytokine release == local inflamm/ cardiorespiratory dysfunction
        * has been found in the lungs of some stillborn infants
        * surfactant function decreased/ decreased production == further hypoxaemia
    + meconium physiology
        * meconium is thick black/green odorless material first appears @3rd month of gestation. (results @desquamation of GI, fatty material, amniotic fluid, protien, lipid, bile)
        * @anal sphincter innervation == decreasd passage by 20 weeks. usu pass meconium post birth. %pass meconium before birth @hypoxia/ umbilical cord compression
        * 
    + cx
        * resp disease/ failure/ acidosis
- clinical
    + risk factors: breech position, black/ south asians, increasing gestational age (++@postmature baby)
    + presentation
        * history of MSAF or evidence of meconium staining on PE of hte infant (vernix stained with M), nails stained
        * often small for gestational age/ postmature, decreased vernix
        *

###### Fertility
    >80% will achieve pregnancy by 6 months 
    >90% will achieve pregnancy by 12 months
    @<35, then start investigating after not pregant @12 months
    @>35, then start investigating after not pregant @6 months (more urgent diagnosis needed)
    however, @not ovulating (eg. amenorrhoea) then require immediate referral

# Fertility assessment
    1/3 purely male problem
    1/3 purely female issue (eg vulation, endometriosis)
    1/3 combination
- HEI   
    + history
        * female
            - age, development, menstrual cycle, history of PCOS
        * male
    + examination
        * very important @may miss obvious causes otherwise
        * BMI (@++estrogen circulating)
        * Male
            - Klinefelter's syndrome (azoospermic)
                + small testis
                + gynaecomastia
                + tall
        * Female
            - 

# Anovulation
- etiology
    + metabolic
        * ADC > 20
        * PCOS and obesity 
    + low FSH (hypogonadism)
        * low weight, stress, high physical activity, pituitary tumor, Kallmann syndrome, infiltrative (sarcoid), Prader-Willi syndrome
        * often requires FSH, and LH agonists (either recombinant or homologous)
    + FSH high (ovarian failure)
        * iatrogenic (chemo/ radiation)
        * autoimmune (SLE, RA)
        * genetic (Fragile X)
        * physiological (menopause)
        * requires IVF with oocytedonation required
    + anatomical
        * mullerian abnormality (abn of uterus and fallopian tubes)
        * endometriosis, fibroids

# IVF
- is best applicable for MAle facotrs @can overcome issue sof sperm not being able to traverse the uterine tract to the egg to fertilise. 
-   process
    + Super ovulation (with FSH and GnRH suppression)
    + induce oocyte maturation
    + collect oocytes
    + fertilisation i nvitro
    + embryo culturing (+/- preimplantation diagnosis)
        * PGD. done for mendelian syndromes, aneuploidy. taken 5 cells from outer layer of the embryo (from teh trophectoderm from teh future placenta). 
    + embryo transfer (often multiple embyos are implanted)
    + vitrification
- indications
    + klinefeleters (testicular microtubular sperm extraction)
    + CF
- 1 IVF cycle just on drugs is $2000

# Oocyte cryopreservation
- future space, can freeze eggs wwhen younger to have more options. medicare assisted @the female has a medical condition that affects fertility (eg cytotoxic therapy)
- extremely expensive, just $6000 to freeze eggs (+500 dollars per year), $1500 on drugs, $1000 in hospital stay, $300 anaethetist, $900 surgeon. 
- freezes the eggs until implantation, and the viability of the eggs will determine success of pregnancy. 51 is general limit -- but this is high risk pregnancy



# Terms
- azoospermic
- Fragile X (CAG repeat with expansion w/ anticipation. gets to a point where <50 copies == normal. 50-200 pre-mutation. >200 copies then full mutation == causes severe fertility issues.). more likely to spread from mother --> child. severe mental disability with typical features. can use pre-implantation diagnosis. 
- ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome


# conditions affecting fertility
- PCOS
    + ovulatory dysfunction, polygenic disease
    + assoc with insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity
    + clinical: -=menstrual periods, hirsutism, HMB, obesity, infertility, acne
    + investigation @US (++large follicles, large ovarian volume), biochemistry (++LH, SHBG reduced, DHEA-s %elevated). OGTT taken every 2 years, monitor for DM
    + risk:
        * rates between thin and obese are simialr
    + mx: overexpress LH receptors in thecal cells in ovary == ++ovarian androgen. Insulin also decreases SHBG (++testerone in blood) == clinical feastures. @++testerone == failure to ovulate == anovulatory subfertility and -=progesterone == %HMB/ %cancer.
    + rx: weight loss (even @small == ++fertility, -=hirsutism, reduceed insulin resistance), PCOS (reduced endometrial hyperplasia in HMB, -=hirsutism), cyproterone (androgenism).

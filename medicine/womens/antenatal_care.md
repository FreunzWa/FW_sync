###### Antenatal care
 - antenatal: aka prenatal, a type of preventative health care, to ensure the healthiest pregnancy without complications
 - about the screening and rx of existing conditions to pregnancy
 - also about general advice to give women @planning a pregnancy + education about pregnancy
 - key aspects of the initial antenatal visists, confirming pregnancy and predicting gestational age


# Pregnancy managemnet overview
    + pre pregnancy counselling
    + first antenatal visit
    + subsequent antenatal visits
    + timing and mode of deliveryt
    + intrapartum care
    + puerperium and lactation



# Pre-pregnancy counselling
- routine screening for general health issues (history, investigations + examination)
    + investigations
        * rubella Abs (unless @previous documentation). live vaccine, contraindicated in pregnancy
        * varicella Abs (in absence of definite past history)
        * pap smear
- general advice for early stages of Pregnancy
    + pharmacological
        * folate supplementation
        * avoid teratogens (eg medications currently on or occupational exposure)
    + behavioural
        * getting pregnant, alcohol, smoking

# First antenatal visit
- confirm pregnancy
    + on history
        * missed period
        * urinary frequency
        * nausea
        * breast
    + examination
        * uterine enlargement (12 weeks abdominally, vaginal enlargement by 8 weeks)
    + investigations
        * serum B-HCG (100% reliable)
        * Urinary CG (cross reacts with LH, -=% false negatives and false positives)
- gestational age
    + investigations
        * US (most accurate).
            - 6-12 weeks (Crown Rump Length - CRL)
            - 12-20 weeks (biparietal diameter - BPD)
        * Menstrual dates  
            - Naegele's rule
                + rule of thumb: 9 months and 1 week since LNMP (adjust for cycle to get exact timing)
                + not reliable @irregular cycle or recently ceased OC pill
- screening for problems
    + Full medical history (Soc history, FHx, menstrual and maternal history)
    + examination
        * genera anthropomorphics
        * gynaecological: external insepction, speculum and bimanual 
    + investigations
        * haematology (Hb, platelets, MCV) -- rule out anaemia/ thalassaemia
        * blood bank (blood group, rhesus typing, antibodies) -- dx and prevention of red cell iso-immunisation
        * microbiology (rubella Ab, VZV @uncertain hisory, syphilis Ab, HepB/C, HIV) -- prevent infection in current pregnancy, vaccinations in puerperium to prevent infection of baby
        * MSU mcs
        * cytology (only @due during the pregnancy) 
        * biochemistry (serum screen for Tri21)
        * imaging (nuchal transclucency, 19 week morphology) -- diagnose T21
- rx of problems
- general advice
    + diet, mineral and vitamin supplementation (Fe, Calcium, VitD, Folate, Iodine -- increased requirement), listeria
    + exercise
        * avoid strenuous @== smaller birth weight. moderate ok.
    + drugs
        * must moderate both smoking (++perinatal mortality) and alcohol (teratogenic)
    + sex
        * sex is fine
    + working
        * most choose to cease work @34 work, some are recommended to cease sooner @placental insuffieincy or elevated BP
    + medication
        * paracetamol fine
        * maxolon for nausea ok
        * peincillin/ amoxicillin okay @UTI
- organise model of care
    + public hospital (normal risk) -- residents and midwives
    + GP "Shared care" -- GP obstetrician
    + Public hospital (high risk) -- specialist obstetric/ reg, subspecialist in fetal Medicine
    + Private obstetrician

# Futrue antenatal visits
- for early diagnosis of pregnancy, esp:
    + pre-eclampsia
    + placental insufficiency
- visit frequency
    + <28 weeks (every 4 weeks)
    + 28-36 weeks (every 2 weeks)
    + 36+ weeks (weekly)
- management
    + general wellbeing
    + fetal movements



# Immunisations in pregnancy
- generally ideally given prior to conception as per the adult guidelines for vaccinations, but @special cases given during preg. 
- vaccines are given @non immune, when there are risks of high exposure and the vaccine is unlikely to harm fetus/ mother. immunisation is effective in pregnant women despite immune changes @pregnancy
- timing of vaccination can be important @changes to placenta == variability of transfer to fetus depending on teh stage. 
    + eg for pertussis vaccine, 27-36 weeks maximum in placental transfer to the fetus
- generally all but live vaccines are considered safe. (live vaccines have the potential for infecting the fetus -- however harmful effects have not been reported, however cannot be totally excluded. only exception @there is a very high risk of exposure to somethng like YF/ polio)
    + @inadvertently given vaccine before knowing pregnancy == must be counselled on the potential effects on fetus
    + recommend do not become pregnant 28 days after receiving live vaccine
    + always ask if woman could be present before receiving live vaccine
- preconception Immunisations
    + according to adult schedule
    + important @MMR and VZV @infection == adverse
        * MMR is livee attenuated. give pre-conception
        * Rubella immunity confirm @lifelong IgG (IgM if suspcious of recent infection)
        * VZV
            - can causee congenital varicella syndrome (severe deefects)
- routine prenatal immunisations
    + tetanus/ diptheria/ pertussis
        * inactivated vaccines, routinely recommended.
            - if previously immune/ completed 3 dose series
                + Td (tetanus and diptheria toxoid), recommended onee dose 27-36 weeks each pregnancy if prev received full 3 dose series
                + Tdap (acellular pertussis), recommeended each pregnancy
            - not prev vaccinated/ no record exists
                + should receive full 3 dose course during 27-36 weeks
        * should also vaccinate household contacts
        * Pertussis can have high morbidity for fetus, and transmitted from family members <3 months of age

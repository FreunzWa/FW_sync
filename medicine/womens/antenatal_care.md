# First antenatal visit
    6 aspects
        confirm preg
        gestational age
        screening for problems
        rx of problems
        general advice
        organise model of care

- confirm pregnancy (HEI)
    + on history
        * missed period (usu PC)
        * urinary frequency (@uterus press bladder)
        * nausea
        * breast tenderness
    + examination
        * uterine enlargement (12 weeks abdominally, vaginal enlargement by 8 weeks, but generally unhelpful)
    + investigations
        * serum B-HCG (100% reliable SN/SP, rare exception of choriocarcinoma)
        * Urinary CG (cross reacts with LH, -=% false negatives and false positives). 
- gestational age
    + investigations
        * dating scan (most accurate @consistent growth over all fetus up to 20 weeks).
            - 6-12 weeks (Crown Rump Length - CRL, accurate +/-3 days)
            - 12-20 weeks (biparietal diameter - BPD, accurate within 7 days)
        * Menstrual dates  
            - Naegele's rule
                + rule of thumb: 9 months and 1 week since LNMP (adjust for cycle to get exact timing)
                + not reliable @irregular cycle or recently ceased OC pill
            - online calculators
- screening for problems
    + Full medical history (Soc history, FHx, menstrual and maternal history)
        * age, PC, PMH, PSH, POH, PGH, medications, allergies (++important @anaphylaxis == ++fatal Risk to fetus and mother)
    + examination
        * general appearance, anthropomorphics (DM, met syndrome, short == difficult delivery), vital signs
        * upper limb, H&N, chest, abdomen, lower limb, neur
        * gynaecological: external insepction, speculum and bimanual 
    + investigations
        * haematology (Hb, platelets, MCV) MCV rule out anaemia/ thalassaemia (thal major risk, need testing)
        * blood bank (blood group, rhesus typing, antibodies) -- dx and prevention of red cell iso-immunisation
        * microbiology (rubella Ab, VZV @uncertain hisory, syphilis Ab, HepB/C, HIV) -- prevent infection in current pregnancy, vaccinations in puerperium to prevent infection of baby
        * MSU mcs (6% women have asymptomatic bactiuria, 1/3 then get pyelonephritis)
        * cytology (CST only @due during the pregnancy) 
        * biochemistry (serum screen for Tri21, NiPT)
        * imaging (nuchal transclucency, 19 week morphology) -- diagnose T21
- rx of problems (optimisation)
    + medications (optimise, stop teratogens)
        * ACEi stop, move to others
    + nutrition
        * multivitamin (Iodine, contains folate but now too late to reverse NTDs)
- general advice
    + diet, mineral and vitamin supplementation (Fe, Calcium, VitD, Folate -- but now too late to commence, Iodine -- increased requirement esp @Iodine deficient in Melbourne), listeria (serious infection, soft cheeses but these are uncommon, uncooked chicken)
    + exercise
        * avoid strenuous @== smaller birth weight and bad outcomes -- the barker hypothesis. moderate ok. 
    + drugs
        * must moderate both smoking (++perinatal mortality) and alcohol (teratogenic)
    + sex
        * sex is fine 
    + working
        * most choose to cease work @34 work, some are recommended to cease sooner @placental insuffieincy or elevated BP 
    + medication
        * paracetamol fine (esp for headaches)
        * maxolon for nausea ok
        * peincillin/ amoxicillin okay @UTI
        * other medications must check with doctor!
- organise model of care (mother chooses)
    + public hospital (normal risk) -- residents and midwives
    + GP "Shared care" -- GP obstetrician
    + Public hospital (high risk) -- specialist obstetric/ reg, subspecialist in fetal Medicine
    + Private obstetrician

# Future antenatal visits
    purpose is to diagnose issues early
- for early diagnosis of pregnancy, esp:
    + pre-eclampsia (HTN, proteinuria and edema)
    + placental insufficiency (-=fetal movements, IUGR)
- visit frequency (but often it is less frequent than this)
    + <28 weeks (every 4 weeks)
    + 28-36 weeks (every 2 weeks)
    + 36+ weeks (weekly)
- management
    + hx
        * general well being
        * fetal movements
        * edema
    + ex
        * weight gain (diet advice), HTN (seated right arm level with heart, phase V), fundal height (>20 weeks, tape measure from top of pubis to top of the uterus.), lie/presentation/station, auscultation (baby heart beat), urinalysis (proteinuria and asymptomatic bactiuria)
- 28 weeks
    + repeat FBE, OGTT (used in pregnancy), anti-D administered if Rh Negative
- 36 weeks
    + FBE, vaginal/perianal swab for GBS (20%carriers, 1/200 get a %fatal infection), anti-D administration @Rh negative
    + ideally vaginal, but C-section may be safer esp breech

# Planning brith
- median onset spontaneous labor is 40 weeks (38 weeks from fertilisation)
- 1/400 have perinatal death/ disability @going beyond 38 weeks

# Immunisations in pregnancy
- generally ideally given prior to conception as per the adult guidelines for vaccinations, but @special cases given during preg. 
- vaccines are given @non immune, when there are risks of high exposure and the vaccine is unlikely to harm fetus/ mother. immunisation is effective in pregnant women despite immune changes @pregnancy
- timing of vaccination can be important @changes to placenta == variability of transfer to fetus depending on teh stage. 
    + eg for pertussis vaccine, 27-36 weeks maximum in placental transfer to the fetus
- generally all but live vaccines are considered safe. (live vaccines have the potential for infecting the fetus -- however harmful effects have not been reported, however cannot be totally excluded. only exception @there is a very high risk of exposure to somethng like YF/ polio)
    + @inadvertently given vaccine before knowing pregnancy == must be counselled on the potential effects on fetus
    + recommend do not become pregnant 28 days after receiving live vaccine
    + always ask if woman could be present before receiving live vaccine
- preconception Immunisations
    + according to adult schedule
    + important @MMR and VZV @infection == adverse
        * MMR is livee attenuated. give pre-conception
        * Rubella immunity confirm @lifelong IgG (IgM if suspcious of recent infection)
        * VZV
            - can causee congenital varicella syndrome (severe deefects)
- routine prenatal immunisations
    + tetanus/ diptheria/ pertussis
        * inactivated vaccines, routinely recommended.
            - if previously immune/ completed 3 dose series
                + Td (tetanus and diptheria toxoid), recommended onee dose 27-36 weeks each pregnancy if prev received full 3 dose series
                + Tdap (acellular pertussis), recommeended each pregnancy
            - not prev vaccinated/ no record exists
                + should receive full 3 dose course during 27-36 weeks
        * should also vaccinate household contacts
        * Pertussis can have high morbidity for fetus, and transmitted from family members <3 months of age


# Models of care
- shared care (SC): hospital shared with @doctor/ loccal midwife affiliiated with hospital (eg 750 doctors and midwives affilitiated @RWH)

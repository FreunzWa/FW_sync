    + first antenatal visit
    + subsequent antenatal visits
    + timing and mode of deliveryt
    + intrapartum care
    + puerperium and lactation



# Pre-pregnancy counselling
- routine screening for general health issues (history, investigations + examination)
    + investigations
        * rubella Abs (unless @previous documentation). live vaccine, contraindicated in pregnancy
        * varicella Abs (in absence of definite past history)
        * pap smear



# Immunisations in pregnancy
- generally ideally given prior to conception as per the adult guidelines for vaccinations, but @special cases given during preg. 
- vaccines are given @non immune, when there are risks of high exposure and the vaccine is unlikely to harm fetus/ mother. immunisation is effective in pregnant women despite immune changes @pregnancy
- timing of vaccination can be important @changes to placenta == variability of transfer to fetus depending on teh stage. 
    + eg for pertussis vaccine, 27-36 weeks maximum in placental transfer to the fetus
- generally all but live vaccines are considered safe. (live vaccines have the potential for infecting the fetus -- however harmful effects have not been reported, however cannot be totally excluded. only exception @there is a very high risk of exposure to somethng like YF/ polio)
    + @inadvertently given vaccine before knowing pregnancy == must be counselled on the potential effects on fetus
    + recommend do not become pregnant 28 days after receiving live vaccine
    + always ask if woman could be present before receiving live vaccine
- preconception Immunisations
    + according to adult schedule
    + important @MMR and VZV @infection == adverse
        * MMR is livee attenuated. give pre-conception
        * Rubella immunity confirm @lifelong IgG (IgM if suspcious of recent infection)
        * VZV
            - can causee congenital varicella syndrome (severe deefects)
- routine prenatal immunisations
    + tetanus/ diptheria/ pertussis
        * inactivated vaccines, routinely recommended.
            - if previously immune/ completed 3 dose series
                + Td (tetanus and diptheria toxoid), recommended onee dose 27-36 weeks each pregnancy if prev received full 3 dose series
                + Tdap (acellular pertussis), recommeended each pregnancy
            - not prev vaccinated/ no record exists
                + should receive full 3 dose course during 27-36 weeks
        * should also vaccinate household contacts
        * Pertussis can have high morbidity for fetus, and transmitted from family members <3 months of age

###### Pregnancy physiology

# Physiological adaptation to pregnancy by system
- cardiac
    + increase CO by 50%
    + TPR and pulmonary resistance falls
- respiratory
    + ++maternal/ fetal O2 requirement (hyperventilation/ ++tidal volume)
- renal
    + increased GFR by 55%
- GIT
    + high progesterone throughout pregnancy reduces LOS tone, reduced GI motility
- metabolic
    + hepatic: ++liver metabolism of placental steroids
    + placental steroids are diabetogenic, (++hyperglycaemia) to supply fetus
- hematological
    + anaemia
    + thrombogenic (incrasead fibrinogen, ++VIII, IX, X, reduced thrombolysis)  
- immune
    + T cell tolerance increased == immunosupperssion
    + B cell preserved (So vaccines work)
    + ++inflammation @high BMI

###### Pregnancy physiology

# Physiological adaptation to pregnancy by system
- cardiac
    + increase CO by 50%
    + TPR and pulmonary resistance falls
- respiratory
    + ++maternal/ fetal O2 requirement (hyperventilation/ ++tidal volume)
- renal
    + increased GFR by 55%
    + ++progesterone == renal tract dilation
- GIT
    + high progesterone throughout pregnancy reduces LOS tone, reduced GI motility
    + ++hyperglycaemia, hyperluipidaemia to favor fetal nutrition. 
    + progesterone relaxes
- metabolic
    + hepatic: ++liver metabolism of placental steroids
    + placental steroids are diabetogenic, (++hyperglycaemia) to supply fetus
- hematological
    + anaemia
    + thrombogenic (incrasead fibrinogen, ++VIII, IX, X, reduced thrombolysis)  
- immune
    + autoimmune diseases remit @T cell suppression
    + B cell preserved (So vaccines work)
    + ++inflammation @high BMI


# Renal adaptations

# Labor
- @rapid volume changes (@valsalva, epidural, sudden blood loss, contractions) == poorly tolerated @:
    + LV dysfunction
    + CO dependent on good preload
    + CO is fixed 

# Postpartum
- ++preload post-deliery. 
    + poorly tolerated @pre-existing cardiac disease (poor LV function)

# Cardiac
- cardiac conditions that confer ++Risk

###### Stillbirth
    death of unborn baby at 20 or more completed weeks gestation OR >400grams birthweight
    before 20 weeks considered a miscarriage (at this stage baby not considered a baby, no death certificate)

- epidemiology
    + 7 per 1000 births in Australia
- risk factors
    + growth restriction (small for gestationa lage)
        * @placental insufficiency 
    + folate deficiency
    + exposure to infection (Syphilis, varicella, listeria, rubella, toxo)
    + pre-eclampsia
    + diseases of the mother
- classification of perinatal death
    + congenital abnormality (anencephaly/ microencephaly w/ high in utero lethality). 
        * hx of teratogen use, 3 generation pedigree, folate supplementation
    + perinatal infection (influenza, rubella, toxoplasmosis, listeria, parovirus, CMV, HSV)
    + hypertension in pregnancy
        * PreE, Chronic HT, Gestational HT, 
    + antepartum hemorrhage
    + maternal medical conditions (SLE, cholestasis, heart disease, resp disase)
        * diabetes
        * hypreteension
        * sLE
        * maternal sepsis (CAmnionitis)
        * cholesstasis of pregnancy (bile acids increased towards ends of pregnancy)
    + hypoxic peripartum death (@intrapartum events)
        * uterine contractions == 40% reduction in placental blood flow (esp issue @placental insufficiency)
        * important to pick up FGR in labor
    + fetal growth restriction
        * ++risk of intrapartum and antenatal stillbirth
        * 50% of worldwide stillborns are FGR
    + placenta
        * placental abruption (premature detachment from the endometrium). usu occurs @uterus reduces in volume while the baby still inside. (eg in twins, after first is delivered.)
        * cord accident (knot in cord), quite rare to cause stillbirth
- obstetric profile
    + stillbirth stable despite efforst @obstetric population (eg aging, ++assisstive reproduction)
    + 25-30 low risk of stillbirth. @40 OR2.3 of stillbirth
    + increasing obesity (++risk of stillbirth @DM/ IUGR/ difficult labor). weight measured @pre-pregnancy/ first antenatal visits.
- presentation
    + maternal: features of underlying condition. 
        * ++absence of fetal movements, disappearance of fetal heart.
        * US confirms no cardiac activity
- investigations
    + full pregnancy and maternal history (prev fhx of similar issues)
    + Kleihauer-Betke test (fetal to maternal hemorrhage)
    + examinatin of baby + clinical photographs
    + autopsy best investigation
    + macroscopic examination fo the cord and placenta +/- histology
    + selecitvE:
        * HbA1c, drug screen, bile acids, LFTs, thrombophilia testing, serology for infection @clinical suspicion
        * fetal CT/ MRI can be used @parents dont want autopsy
- labour and delivery after diagnosis
    + safe to wait, use private room, same as regular delivery
- postnatal care/ support
    + often may not want to see the baby, but can describe the baby, may want to see the baby after. 
    + create momentos/ memorial services (photographs, footprints/ hands)
    + parent support groups
    + make them understand that you believe the baby's life was significant.
    + bereavement support/ pastoral support
    + suppression of lactation (remove reminer of the baby)
        * bromocriptine/ cabergoline (dopamine agonists to suppress prolactin)
        * dont express the milk (@positive feedback cycle)

###### Diabetes in pregnancy
    GDM diagnosed @OGTT, but @preexisting diabetes == do not need OGTT

# GDM
    50% will need insulin
    some get metformin
- medical
    + mx
        * human placental lactogen released @progressively higher in T2 similar structure to IGF == promotes insulin resistance == hyperglycaemia
        * %also @higher levels of cortisol release @pregnancy == hyperglycaemia
    + cx
        * unlike prepreganncy risk not much increased of anatomical malformations @more about glycaemic control in T1
- diagnosis
    + OGTT required to diagnose
        * FBG >5.1 OR 1-hr value >10 OR 2-hr value >8.5
- screening
    + early pregnancy
        * low @no risk factors == RBG early pregnancy
        * moderate @BMI25-35, ethnicity, Fhx diabetes, previous macrosomia == FBG early pregnancy
        * high @abnormal RBG/ FBG, multiple moderate RFs, previous GDMM, maternal age >40, BMI>35, PCOS, corticosteroid or antipsychotic use == OGTT early pregnancy
    + 26-28 week OGTT 
        * fasting 75g glucose load given, followed by plasma glucose 1-2 hrs. fasted overnight.
- treatment
    + surveillance 
        * 4x daily home blood glucose monitoring
        * target FBG <5.1, 2 hr postprandial <6.7
            - @persistently missing targets despite deit/ exercise == insulin used.
        * insulin BB regimen. preprandial short accting + medium/ long acting insulin
    + screening for fetal anomalies
        * conduct 18-22 week morphology scan
        * third trimester screening to detect PI (28 and 34 weeks, also to awssess growth )

        

# Pre-pregnancy diabetes
- medical
    + complications on pregnnacy
        * 2x risk of NTDs, CVD abnormalities, GI abn, GU abn, caudal regression syndrome (sacral agenesis)
        * FDIU/ miscarriage
        * PET
        * polyhydramnios
        * preterm labor
        * PI
        * macrosomia (shoulder dystocia)
        * infections
        * neonatal: respiratory distress, hypoglycaemia
    + pregnancy on diabetes
        * T1 == better glucose control @fetal demands/ -=appetite
        * ++hPL == T2 reversal == poorer control
        * @delivery == rapid reversal == lower insulin requirements because no more hPL
        * may be more rapid progression of retinopathy/ nephropathy, hypoglcaemic attackcs/ ketoacidosis
- managmenet
    + prepregnancy
        * normal prepregnancy stuff (CST, rubella, varicella, general assessment)
        * screen for hypothyroidism/ celiac disease
        * 5mg folate
        * assess of control, glucose levels, HbA1c
        * screen for renal function/ retinopathy
        * stress smoking @compouns with DM
    + first antenatal
        * accurate GA assessment w/ early US
    + surveillance
        * home BG monitoring 4x daily
        * fasting BGs and 2 hours after every meal
        * maintain 4.5-5.5 FBGs, 6-7 postprandials
        * aim HbA1c 6-7%, monitor 4 weekly
    + managmenet
        * diet and exercise
        * basal-bolus insulin
            - medium-long acting insulin taken at night (eg isophane)
            - short acting preprandial 
    + dropping insulin requirements
        * may indicate fetal compromise

# T2DM

# T1DM



# Timing of delivery
    important not to allow to late @higher risk of PI and FDIU in this population
    38-39 weeks in general, but may be earlier @appearance of PET
- in general, 38-39 weeks. 40 weeks reasonable @GDM and no other complications/ macrosmia.
- mode
    + elective CS @previous CS/ malpresentation/ macrosomia (esp >4250g) in general
    + 50% elective CS @prepregnancy DM
    + 25% elective CS @GDM
- perioperative
    + morning insulin dose withheld
    + insulin/ dextrose infusions are administered, and continued postoperatively.
- intrapartum care
    + oral intake encourage, insulin as normal before
    + urine tested for ketones (@high, oral intake increased/ dextrose)
    + fetal monitoring
    + monitor for shoulder dystocia
    + epidural analgesia %needed @prolonged labor
    + lithotomy position
    + pushing in 2nd stage CI @diabetic proliferative retinopathy
    + umbilical cord clamped early @neontal polycthaemia
- puerperium care
    + insulin infusion ceased @NVD
    + @prepregnancy == revert to original dose prepregnancy, may be higher @lactation requires additional 50g of carbohydrate.
- neonatal
    + often macrosomic, hypotonic, difficult to feed like immature baby
    + higher risk of atelectasis and RDS
    + check for anomalies
- outcomes
    + should have GTT at approx 6 weeks postpartum to ensure resolution
    + higher risk of DM in child, esp @both parents.
    + 25% risk of diabetes requiring treatment by 15 years

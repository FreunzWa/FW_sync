# to study
- sheehans
- histiocytosis
- mumps oophoritis

- Mayer-Rokitansky-
KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome
- ashermans
- pit stalk compression

# Amenorrhoea
    primary Amenorrhoea 
    secondary Amenorrhoea (most commonly encountered)
    oligorrhoea
[primary Amenorrhoea; none @16 OR none @15 + no sex chars]
[secondary Amenorrhoea; none @6 months + normal before]
[hypogonadism; gonad dysfunction @ovaries/ testes]
[hypogonadtrophic hypogonadism; @HPA dysfx == -=FSH/ LH hypogonadism {central cause}]
[hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism; @gonads stuffed == FSH/LH veery high {secondary cause}]
[cryptomenorrhoea; blood acc in vaginal tract @obstruction]
[haematocolpos; blood acc in vagina]
- physiology of menstruation
    + @GnRH == FSH/LH == ovary == E2/P4 == proliferation / shedding == bleeding
- primary Amenorrhoea
    + 0.1-0.3% prevalence
    + 50%@HPA/ 50%@ovarian/uterine/GU tract
        * HPA (-= 2nd sex chars): chronic illness, genetic abnormalities 
        * anatomical (2nd sex chars present): obstruction (vag aenesis, transverse vaginal septum/ cervical stenosis/ atresia/  imperforate hymen) == cryptomenorrhoea treat @surgery
- secondary Amenorrhoea
    + 85%@HPA
        * HPA
            - central (HPA == low FSH/ LH): 
                + @stress/ constitutional /Kallmann's, AN, hormone contraception, hyperandrogenism (PCOS), pregnancy, PRL. 
                + pituitary: neoplasia (PRL producing OR mass effect),  sheehan's, infiltrative, PRL high @medications/ hypothyroidism/ lactating
            - peripheral (ovarian insufficiency == high FSH/ LH)
                + ovaries not produce E2/P4 @ no eggs (menopause) / premature ovarian filaure (POF)/ mumps/ autoimmune ovarian faillure
        * anatomical rarer: %@adhesions post surgery/ instrumentation/ infection
- nat history
    + @low E2 == osteopororis, low fertility @anovulation

    + ?vis fields ?obstructed gynae
- investigations
    + HPA: P4/ E2/ FSH/ LH
    + TFT/ PRL
    + USS @obstruction (%CT/ MRI)
    + autoantibodies to ovary
    + mumps serology
- treatment
    + hypogonadism: address estrogen def (estrogen replacement @OCP), address fertility (%IVF)
    + treated endocrine conditions
    + obstruction: surgery (hymenectomy)
    + ovulation induction @GnRH injections, surgical induction @PCOS, tamoxifen, estrogens, clomiphene, letrozole
    + PRL: dopamine agonists (bromocript, cabergoline), surgery, irradiation

# Sexual development
    2nd sexual characteristics
- secondary sexual characteristics
    + females
        * breast enlargement
        * hamstring muscle grow
        * axillary/ pubic hair
        * ++Fat @hips/ buttocks/ thighs
        * labia minora prominent
    + males
        * @T == ++muscles/ bones growth
        * quadriceps
        * larynx/ vocal cords == deepen voice
        * broadening of shoulderes
        * ++secretions of oil @sweat glands
        * facial hair
- assessment
    + Tanner staging; assesses testicular and breast growth, pubic hair

# Sexual Genetic disorders
    Kallmann syndrome
- Kallmann syndrome (Kallmann's hereditary anosmia)
    + prevents puberty (@hypogonadtropic hypogonadism) @hypothalamus stuffed == -=E2/P4/DHT. cant smell. -=2nd sex chars. infertile. ++OP risk. ++@males. polygenetic.
- Klinefelter syndrome 
- Turner syndrome

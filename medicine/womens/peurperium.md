###### puerperium - Phsyiology and lactation
    six week period following childbrith with uterus involution and lactation

# Medical management for normal puerperium
- C-section
    + increased analgesia requirements @abdo scar
    + -=mobility
- lactation
- perineal pain
- pelvic floor exercises

# Uterine involution
- physiology
    + @pregnancy, takes 12 weeks to emerge from the pelvis to be felt @abdo examination
    + @puerperium == takes 12 days to go back

# Perineal pain
- ++edematous/ painful/ strethced aftger delivery
- vaginal

# Estrogen withdrawal
- physiology    
    + @lactation == Estrogen suppression == atrophic vagina, cervix annd endometrium 
- causes vaginal dryness/ pain/ painful intercourse (mayu require lubrication for sexual activity)

# Other physiological changes in puerperium
- cardiovascular
    + @decompression of VC and autotransfusion of utero placental blood == ++50% increase CO
- renal system
    + %macroscopic haematuria @damage duringv prengnayc
    + %get urinary retention, treat with catheter
- haematology
    + hyperocoagulable state like pregnancy, actually higher risk of VTE than in pregnancy
- GIT

# Lochia
    lochia is normal PV discharge from uterus @healing placenntal site. persist up to 8 weeks with color changing from red to yellow to white
- normal lochia loss
    + vaginal discharge after birth containing lbood, mucus, uterine tissue. continues 4-6 wks after childbirth
        * Lochia Rubra (3-4 days)
        * Lochia Serosa (3 weeks)
        * Lochia Alba  (10 days- 6 weeks)
- lochia should smell similar to normal menstrual fluid. @offensive/ greenish color == contamination by chlamydia etc

# Breast feeding
    @explusion of POC == less sex hormone release == prolactin release == milk production. 
    @tactile stimulation fo the breats == oxytocin releaes == smooth muslce contraction of the breeast == ejection of milk and out of fthe small holes around the nipple. oxytocin release == better expulsion of the uterus (which is why breast feeding is preferable.) -- experience afterpains.
[colostrum; first milk to be expressed. low in volume, rich in protein including IgA.]
- benefits
    + maternal
        * reduced bleeding
        * faster return to prepregnancy weight
        * reduced risk of ovarian and breast cancer
    + neonatal
        * reduced infection risk/ atopy/ childhood diabetes/ obesity
- low supply/ not breastfeeding enough
    + clinical features
        * baby crying freuqently inbetwen meeals - not settled after meals
        * weight loss/ inadequate weight gian
        * signs of dehydration (-=WN, infrequent concentrated urine)
    + differentials
        * baby cannot suck properly (preterm/ neuromuscular baby/ T21/ tongue tied)
        * sore cracked nipples
    + post partum illness (eg @PPH == anaemia == interfers betwween supply)
    + rf for low supply: preterm baby/ neuromuscular baby == cannot suck properly == less milk production. Eg @cleft lip or duodenal atresia
    + Sheehan's syndrome (pituitary apoplexy) @PPH/ hypotension causes pituitary infarction / failure == prolactin insufficiency
    + medications ()
    + lack of social supporots
    + lack of maternal care/ education/ lactation consultation
    + also using formula
    + doesnt understand benefits of breast feeding
    + other medications (dopaminergic agonists)
    + anatomical abrnoamlities (inverted nipples)
    + maternal obesity
- technique
    + both in comfortable position
    + baby's back supported, held securely and brought to the breast
    + opne babys mouth with rooting rreflex
    + good attchment with ++breast taken with most of areola (otherwise == trauma of the nipple)
    + @depress breast == blockage of some of the ducts
    + in teh first several minutes baby drinks 90% of teh milk.
    + offer other breast
    + no set time for feeding
- increasing supply
    + medications: DA antagonists (oral domperidone). tds for 1-2 weeks. 
- CI to breastfeeding   
    + cannabis use can cause neurodevelopmental problems
    + HIV advised to suppress lactation
    + infantile metabolic disorders (PKU, urea cycle disorders)
    + HCV infected mothers riks @blood exposure.
    + receiving chemotherapy/ radiotherapy
    + immunosuppressant use

# Return to fertility
    ovulation as early as 4 weeks after pregnancy



# Other consideration
- when can CST
    + best to delay 8-10 weeks after delivery @estrogen withdrawal == atrophic cervix. can use 2 week course of topical estrogene before examination to increase chance of success.



# Recovery from C-section
    normal to have reduced mobility esp 6-24 hours @analgesia/ parenteral analgesia.
- rx
    + requires sufficient analgesia to promote early mobility (maternal analgesia is safe for infants)
    + IV fluids required until oral intake is sufficicent
    + urinary catheter removed 6-24 hrs after surgery @which point woman cna use toilet 
    + education as per NVD with regards to lactation, lochia, laerninng pareting skills
    + D/C @no requirements for parenteral analgesia
    + removal of sutures ~7 days after operation

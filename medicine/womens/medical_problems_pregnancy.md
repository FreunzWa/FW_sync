    + Direct (a direct maternal death is a direct obstetric complication of pregnancy/ delivery/ or their management)
    + Indirect (a disease unrelated to preganncy aggravated by teh physiological stress of the pregnancy state)
    + Accidental/ Incidental (unrelated to pregnancy)
- Causes of direct maternal death
    + amniotic fluid embolism
    + hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
    + thrombosis and TE
    + obstetric haemorrhage
    + cardiac conditions


# Cardiac disease in pregnancy
- Eisenmenger's syndrome: long standing left to right cardiac shunt (caused @congenital heart diease) reverses to become a right to left shunt. @pregnancy mortality is high, esp after delivery. usu onset later in life @progressive pulmonary HT caused @maladaptation @higher right sided heart pressures. eventually RVH == right sided pressure exceeds left == significant cyanosis == end organ ischaemia.

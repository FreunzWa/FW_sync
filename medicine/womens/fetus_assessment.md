###### Assessment of fetal wellbeing
    assessment typically begins after 20 weeks @placental sufficiency will determine the health and growth of the fetus

# Fetal assessment
- assessment of fetal growth
    + history
        * movements start at 8 weeks, but noticeable from about 20 weeks.
    + clinical examination
        * fundal height assessment: assessment of top of the uterus to measure distention. more accurate @use tape measure and compare to standard charts
        * US assessment: 
            - serial measurements >2 weeks apart
            - biometrics
                + biparietal diameter (BPD)
                + head circumfrence (HC)
                + abdominal circumfrence (AC): best measure @more data, restricted @-=adipose
                + femur length (FL)
                + biometrics combined in formula to determine estimate of fetal weight percentile. accurate within 15%
                + head to abdo ratio (head disprop large in proportion to abdominal size @malnourished)
            - fetal movements
                + body movmeents, breathing movemets, muscle tone (flexion signifies wellness)
            - liquor volume
                + amniotic fluid assessment (wellbeing). amniotic fluid index: 
            - vascular doppler measurements
                + umbilical artery waveform @curling. use ratio from peak systolic and end diastolic.
                + reduced: SDR > 3 (placental resistance)
                    * @causes the end diastolic flow is ++decreased
                + reversed diastolic flow is severe (++perinatal mortality)
                + usu @placental hypoxia == placental arteriolar constrcition == placental hypertension and decreased perfusion. 
        * CTG
            - fetal heart rate over time, use @both antenatal and labor. 
            - 4 components:
                + baseline
                    * normal 110-160
                + variability
                    * the micro-variations around the baseline
                    * usu 5-25 bpms
                        - increased (>25 bpm) hypoxia
                        - reduced (3-5) hypoxia, sleeping, sedated "non reactive"
                            + etiology of reduced: sick (hypoxia), sleeping, sedated, submature
                        - absent (<3 bpm) severe hypoxia
                + accelerations
                    * normal: 2 x 15bpm increase in 20'
                    * periods of fetal activity 
                + decelerations
                    * normal: no ominous decelerations.
                    * 4 types:
                        - early decelerations (simultaneous, mirror image of contraction due to head compression. very uncommon, but not a concern)
                        - late decelerations (after contractions, look same as early but timing after. means that there is underlying hypoxia. shallow late decelerations even worse @means baby is not compensating). @contraction == -=placental blood flow == systemic vasoc of the fetus == diverted to brain and heart.
                        - variable decelerations (rapid onset and rapid recovery. due to cord compression of contraction. very common. varying width/ depthsilly name - better would be 'cord decelerations')
                            + mild: >60 secs
                            + moderate: >60 secs
                            + severe: rebound tachy (shooting above baseline), delayed recovery, >60 secs
                        - prolonged deceleration (sustained bradycardia) 
                            + caused @cord compression (@compression in birth canal), maternal hyoptension (eg after given anaesthetics), sustained uterine contraction, placental abruption
            - used in antenatal period to assess wellbeing, indirect test for hypoxia
            - healthy
                + 5-25 bpm variability
        * Kick chart
        * biochemical test
            - estriol (not done anymore, but new tests are emerging)

# CTG classification
- reactive
- non reactive in labor (sedation most likely -- just keep monitoring)
- critical (immediate CS. induce doesnt work @more contractions and takes ++time to deliver)


# Fetal growth restriction
    FGR: failure to reach optimal growth potential
    SGA: less <10th percentile for stage of gestation
- induction of labor at 37-38 weeks reduces the risk of stillbirth if the pregnancy s allowed to go to term

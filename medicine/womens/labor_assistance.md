###### Induction and augmentation of labor
    labor: process of causing labor to commence. 25% of pregnancies reach situation in which induction is favored. 
        Weigh up labor induction and  C-section vital. can the fetus make it through a lengthy labor?
    augmentation: stimulating a lbaor already commenced
- risks of continuing the pregnancy must be weighed against those of interrupting the pregnancy

# Induction of labor
- indications
    + postmaturity (usu 10-14 days)
        * placenta begins to deteriorate == fetal compromise/ hypoxia
    + hypertensive disease (prec, HTN)
    + diabetes
    + ruptured membranes +/- choroamnionitis
        * the membranes are likely to stimulate labor @40 weeks, however @not stimulate labor == likely attempt to induce labor.
        * membranes can break very early eg 20 weeks cannot induce labor.
    + fetal growth restriction/ suspected PI
        * placental insufficiency == FGR. induce labor esp @late in gestation, earlier have to make cliical decision.
    + fetal compromise (eg hypoxia)
        * %signified @loss of FMs. risk of deterioriation @not delivered
    + blood group isoimmunisation
        * requires specialist management + early delivery. 
    + placental abruption
    + twin pregnancy
    + fetal death in utero (stillbirth)
    + significant fetal abnormality
    + social reasons (to time the birth

# Contraindications to induction of labor
- prematurity (avoid unless there is absolute indication)
- FGR/ fetal compromise (if so growth restricted or compromised so that may not make it through), then a C-section is indicated.
- no induction for transverse or breech
- placenta praevia (in the way of the birth canal)
    + Grade,2,3,4 should get a C-section
- previous C-section    
- cephalopelvic disproportion (huge baby, small woman), should have a CS

# Induction of labor
    induction of labor will require 1+ of the following methods, or a combination of all of them
- 3 Methods
    + Cervical ripening
        * used @cervix has a narrow opening/ is hard (if already few cm open then no need)
        * Prostin E2
            - placed in the vagina, ripens and soften the cervix and partly dialte to allow amniotomy.
            - can cause uterine hyperstimulation (worst outcome being uterine rupture)
            - not to use with previous uterine scar or with ruptured membranes
    + Amniotomy
        * artificial rupture of the membranes. small hook used to ruture the forewaters.
        * the cervix needs to be first dilated.
        * the baby's head needs to be applied to the cervix to allow the water to dribble slowly. if station is higher then risk umbilicus coming out first, the rest of the waters rushing out
    + Syntocinon
        * stimulates uterine muscle contraction
        * IV titration according to response. start very low dose. 
        * CTG monitoring requird due to uterine hyperstimulation which could cause fetal compromise. 
        * SEs: nausea, vomiting, intoxication, hyponatremia.
- Complications
    + cord prolapse (@ARM)
    + uteirne hyperstimulation == rupture
    + fetal distress
    + failure of induction (possible need for CS)


# Instrumental delivery
    instrumental delivery is used to facilitate / expedite vaginal delivery
- instruments/ means of delivery
    + occiput-anterior: neville barnes forceps (around head, pull out)
    + occiput-transverse: 
    + occiput-posterior:
        * manual rotation
        * ventouse: flex baby's head often rotates it
        * Kielland's forceps: can be used to rotate into OA (however not used as much @can harm the baby).
- forceps divided by cephalic station
    + the baby's head needs to be at least at the level of the ischial spines. if not, the baby is a HIGH station. cannot do instrumental (too dangerous and difficult) - do a CS
    + mid cavity, still difficult, better to wait and be patient
    + low instrumental delivery is much easier
- indciations
    + delay in the second stage of labor
        * esp @fetal distress/ effective epidural (may decrease urge to push)
- requirements
    + consent
    + cervix must be fully dilated
    + presentation must be cephalic (except FACH of breech -- forceps on head after legs)
    + head's position must be known exactly.
    + must eb in lithotomy position
    + forceps usu require episiotomy @increase effective size of fetal head (allow the delivery to be faster). vontouse sometimes dont need episiotomy.

# Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome
    most seriosu complication of conttrolled ovarian hyperstimulation
    clinical @abdo distention, ascites, large ovaries @3rd spacing
    most are mild-moderate cases, managed as OP
- @hyperstimulated usu @fertility treatments == ++follicles recruited == susatined production of VEGF by corpora lutea after hCG administration, == ++leaky vascularisation around follicles == fluid leakage into peritoneal cavity == VEGF impairs systemic blood vessels == third spacing == edema/ ascites/ shock/ pericardial effusion due to increased systemic permeability
- only occurs @exognous HCG used.  
- very rarely @endogenosu HCG, %%@rare mutations in FSH gene == chronic OHSS during prengnacy. also @++TSH during pregnancy can mimic by binding to teh estrogen receptors\
- rf
    + PCOS
    + previous episode of OHSS
* HEI   
    - H
        + ask prior history of ovarian stimulation
        + rule out ruptured ovarian cyst/ ovarian torsion and may also have free fluid in abdomen
        + time forms
            * early OHSS: 4-7 days after hcg. 
            * late: at least 8 days after, this form is more severe due to a higher HCG in pregnancy
        + severity forms
            * mild: abdo distention/ discomfort/ mild nausea/ vomiting and diarrhoea. no biochem abnormalities
            * moderate: ascites on US + features of mild US. ovaries huge, up to 12 cm
            * severe: ascites and severe abdo pain, %pleural effusion, leukocytosis, hypoxia @respiratory compromise.
            * critical @shock and DIC, VTE, liver failure, encephalopathgy
    - E
    - I
        + TVUS to look for ovarian size
* management
    - mild: OP rx, paracetamol and bedreest annd return @worse
    - moderate: oral fluid 1-2 litres. NO DIURETICS @worsen decreased IV volume
    - daily weights and abdo circs
    - severe: hospitalise, refer to tert, saline or albumin infusion. thromboprophylaxis.
    - critical: ICU, full investigations and monitorign of CVP, thromboprophylaxis

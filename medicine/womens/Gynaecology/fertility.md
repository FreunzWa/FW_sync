###### Fertility
    defintiion: failure to concenive after 1 year of regular appropriately timed intercourse 

    approx 80-85% of couples will conceive in first year of attempting
    Most common:
        Anovulation
        Endometriosos
        Tubal disease
        Male factor
    when to investigate will depend on what age::
    @<35, then start investigating after not pregant @12 months
    @>35, then start investigating after not pregant @6 months (more urgent diagnosis needed)
    however, @not ovulating (eg. amenorrhoea) then require immediate referral
    management is mainly IVF, produces pregnancy in 30% oft hose unable to concenive.
    causes 1/3 1/3 1/3 to male factor, female factor and combined.

# approach
    Vital to have both partners present
    1/3 purely male problem
    1/3 purely female issue (eg vulation, endometriosis)
    1/3 combination

# History
+ history
    * sexual intercours ehistoyr
        - duration of attempte4d conception (how long failed for)
    * female
        - age
        - past reproductive history and outcomes
        - menstrual cycle (looking for anovulator, frequency, regualirty, symptoms of ovulation)
        - sexual history (Frequency and timing)
        - symptoms 
            + (eg suggestive of endometriosiis - dyspareunia, dysmenorrhoea)
            + suggestive of PCOS (weight gain, hirsutism)
        - age, development,  history of PCOS, prev obs and gynae history
        - visual distrubance
        - medications/ smoking/ drug and aclcohol
        - past exposure to chemotherapy (gonadotoxin)
    * male
        - prev paternities
        - undescended testicles, mumps, trauma, surgery including vasectomy
        - libido, shaving, freuqency of erections
        - ability to sustain erection through intercourse
        - heavy alcohol intake/ exogenous sterods use
        - past STI history
        - occupation (heat and toxi agents)
        - past med/ surge history
        - fmaily history
        - prev chemotherapy/ gonadotoxic therapy
        - anabolic steroid use

# Examination
- examination
    + very important @may miss obvious causes otherwise
    + BMI (@++estrogen circulating)
    + Male
        * Klinefelter's syndrome (azoospermic)
            - small testis
            - gynaecomastia
            - tall
        * body habitus, height, weight BM, muscle mass and strength, fat distribution
        * secondary sexual characteristics
        * gynaecomastia
        * blood pressure lying/ standing
        * inguinal canals
        * testicular examintaion (msases, hydrocele, size with orchidometer, presence of vas deferens/ epididymis)
    + Female
        * body habitus, height weight, BMI
        * hirsutism/ acne (Ferriman-Gallwey score)
        * visual fields
        * galactorrhoea (prolactin)
        * thyroid examintaion


# Investigations
+ investigations
    * male
        - semen analysis (volume, count, total count, normal forms, motility, progressive motility, live)
        - STI screen
    * As indicated
        - prolactin/ MRI pituitary
        - FSH/ LH/ testostrone
        - thyroid, adrenal
        - karytopye
        - Y chromosome microdeletions
        - CF gene mutations (bil absence of vas)
        - sperm autoAbs
        - testicular ultrasound
    * female
        - ovulation confirmation (mid-luteal progesterone)
        - anatomical/ patency (hysteroscopy, lap and dye, hysterosalpingoram, saline sonohysterography)
        - endometriosis (US/ laparoscopy)
        - reserve assessment (day 3 FSH and LH. and AMH levels - to get the reserve of eggs)
        - additional @anvolation: 
            + FSH/ LH/ prolactin 
            + TFTs
            + androgens
            + bHCG
            + MRI pituitary
        - screening for STIs / CST withb PCR swabs/ first pass urine samples if indicated
            + especially Chlaymida and gonorrhoea which can cause PID and salpingitis which can cause permanet scarring. 



# Infertility
    12 monts of regular unprotected intercourse without conception
- main causes
    + ovulatory dysfunction
        * ejaculatory duct blockage
    + sperm issues
    + functional sexual problems (actually have sex)
    + anatomical issues 
    + pelvic pathology
    + testicular or ovarian failure


# Management
- correct reversible factors
- keep trying (especially if matenral aageage is not an issue)
- laparoscopy
- IUI (mild sperm issue == deliver the sperm deep into endometriu, without needing to take the egg out)
    + usu only for mild male factor infertrility
- IVC
- ICSI. For severe male factor subfertility or non patent fallopian tubes.
    + intracytoplasmic sperm injection
- Vasectomy
    + (microsurgery to reverse)
- Donor sperm
- cryopreservation
    + @chemotherapy/ radiotherapy == testicular/ ovarian fa8ilure == can freeze efore == used later.



# Anovulation
- etiology
    + metabolic
        * ADC > 20
        * PCOS and obesity 
    + low FSH (hypogonadism)
        * low weight, stress, high physical activity, pituitary tumor, Kallmann syndrome, infiltrative (sarcoid), Prader-Willi syndrome
        * often requires FSH, and LH agonists (either recombinant or homologous)
    + FSH high (ovarian failure)
        * iatrogenic (chemo/ radiation)
        * autoimmune (SLE, RA)
        * genetic (Fragile X)
        * physiological (menopause)
        * requires IVF with oocytedonation required
    + anatomical
        * mullerian abnormality (abn of uterus and fallopian tubes)
        * endometriosis, fibroids

# IVF
    rocket to get sperm to destination, also for pre implantation genetic diagnosis
- is best applicable for MAle facotrs @can overcome issue sof sperm not being able to traverse the uterine tract to the egg to fertilise. 
-   process
    + Super ovulation (with FSH and GnRH suppression)
    + induce oocyte maturation
    + collect oocytes
    + fertilisation i nvitro
    + embryo culturing (+/- preimplantation diagnosis)
        * PGD. done for mendelian syndromes, aneuploidy. taken 5 cells from outer layer of the embryo (from teh trophectoderm from teh future placenta). 
    + embryo transfer (often multiple embyos are implanted)
    + vitrification
- indications
    + Klinefelter's (testicular microtubular sperm extraction)
    + CF
- 1 IVF cycle just on drugs is $2000

# HEI
- Examination 
    + testicular
        * infantile size testis@ Klinefelter
        * smaller size in non obstructive azoospermic
        * normal size @obstructive azoospermic

# Oocyte cryopreservation
- future space, can freeze eggs wwhen younger to have more options. medicare assisted @the female has a medical condition that affects fertility (eg cytotoxic therapy)
- extremely expensive, just $6000 to freeze eggs (+500 dollars per year), $1500 on drugs, $1000 in hospital stay, $300 anaethetist, $900 surgeon. 
- freezes the eggs until implantation, and the viability of the eggs will determine success of pregnancy. 51 is general limit -- but this is high risk pregnancy



# Terms
- azoospermic
- Fragile X (CAG repeat with expansion w/ anticipation. gets to a point where <50 copies == normal. 50-200 pre-mutation. >200 copies then full mutation == causes severe fertility issues.). more likely to spread from mother --> child. severe mental disability with typical features. can use pre-implantation diagnosis. 
- ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (use of bHCG during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation)


# conditions affecting fertility
- PCOS
    + ovulatory dysfunction, polygenic disease
    + assoc with insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity
    + clinical: -=menstrual periods, hirsutism, HMB, obesity, infertility, acne
    + investigation @US (++large follicles, large ovarian volume), biochemistry (++LH, SHBG reduced, DHEA-s %elevated). OGTT taken every 2 years, monitor for DM
    + risk:
        * rates between thin and obese are simialr
    + mx: overexpress LH receptors in thecal cells in ovary == ++ovarian androgen. Insulin also decreases SHBG (++testerone in blood) == clinical feastures. @++testerone == failure to ovulate == anovulatory subfertility and -=progesterone == %HMB/ %cancer.
    + rx: weight loss (even @small == ++fertility, -=hirsutism, reduceed insulin resistance), PCOS (reduced endometrial hyperplasia in HMB, -=hirsutism), cyproterone (androgenism).
- thyroid disease (hypothyroidism/ hyperthyroidism)
- obesity/ metabolic syndrome


# Polycystic ovarian syndrome
    misnomer @ovaries are not cysts but rather polyfollicular 
    ovulatory dysfunction + androgen excess
    assoc with obesity and INS resistance.
    12% prevalence estimated, most common cause of subfertility
- medical
    + rf
        * @family clustering (polygenetic)
        * NOT elevated BMI (rates of PCOS similar -- however ++BMI exacrbates INS resistance)
    + assoc with multiple endocrine dysfunction (insulin, LH, elevated androgens from the ovaries).
    + mx
        * @hyperINS AND @++LH secreted @pit (due to more frequent GnRH pulsatile surges) == ++theca cells produce androstenedione which circulates and is converted in peripheral tissues to testosterone (adrenergic clinical features) and estrogen
        * also @hyperINS == less SHBG == more free DHT from any source
        * @++androgens == inhibition of ovulation == anovulatory subfertility
        * @no progesterone == estrogne chronically unopposed == HMB, high ratees of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, so therefore usualyl treated with progesterone only pills
- clinical 
    + features
        * oligomenorrhoea (cycles >35 days or fewer than 9 periods per year), heavy menstrual bleeding
        * hirsutism 
        * acne
- diagnosis
    + 2+ of the following
        * PCOS morphology on US
        * oligomenorrhoea / anovulation
        * hyperandrogenism (either lcinical or on serum testing)
    + Differentials
        * CAH
        * premature ovarian insufficiency
        * hyperprolactinaemia
        * thyroid issues
- HEI
    + H
        * rule out other causes of menstrual irregularities eg thyroid, prolactin issues, premature ovarian insufficiency, pregnancy
    + I
        * 'Polycystic' ovaries on pelvic ultrasound
            - for PCOS requires:
                + 12+ follcieles on either ovartyt measure 2-9mm
                + ovarian volume >10mL on TVUS
        * Testing for anovulation
            - lack of LH surge or lack of progeseterone rise 
        * progesterone tolerance test
            - causes a withdrawal bleed
        * mid-luteal progesterone level
        * FSH vs. LH levels
            - LH higher than FSH on day 3
        * Androgens
            - reduced SHBG (not diagnostic)
            - elevvated serum testosterone
            - high free androgens index
        * GTT
            - at diagnosis then every 2 years
            - and other assessment for metablic syndromes
- management
    + weight loss (at least 5%): D&E. almost always recommend.
    + COCP
        * first line treatment for hirsutism
        * protects against endometrial hyperplasia
        * CI'd @trying to get pregnant
    + Mirena
        * preevent endometrial hyperplasia, reduces bleeding. does not help with hirsutism. 
    + Spironolactone
        * for hirsutism
    + Clomiphene
        * helps to allow ovulation @centrally acting estrogen receptor antagoninst == LH surge == ovulation. dont take @unexplainied uterine bleeding

# Female factor infertility
    multifactorial minor cause: multiple contributing factors to infertiltiy which each individually insufficient to cause infertility. 
- anovulatory infertiltiy
    + hypothalamic dysfunction
        * stress, sudden weight changes, intercurrent illness, hyper or hypothyroidism
        * PCOS is the most common, but LH higher than FSH on  day 3 of the cycle than by factor of 2:1 (usu FSH higher)
    + pituitary dysfunction
        * eexcess prolactin (prolactinoma of the atnerior pituitary)
        * Sheehan's syndrome (damage to pit == cannot reeleaes FSH and LH)
    + tubal factors 
        * pelvic inflammaotry disease (eg PID usu @chlamydia trachomatis %%N gonorrhoeae)
        * acute salpingitis/ %with blockage after scarring
    + ovarian failure (raised LH/ FSH)
    + endometriosis
        * mx: adhesions obstruct tube, dyspareunia decreased sexual frequency, toxic environment for the oocyte
    + coital
        * @high frequency sperm density not decreased. timing importannt, @sperem last 5 days, oocyte 24 hours
    + uterine factors:
        * uterinee abnormalities eg seeptum, adhesions eg S@asherman syndrome, endometrialk  polyps/ fibroids. mullerian abnormalities (more commonly recurrent miscarraige) 


# Male factor infertility

                + mumps: permanent inflammatory destruction of the testis
- approach
    + HE: 
        * detailed female partner history (as with female). 
        * sexual dev history, testicular descnet, pubertal development, loss of body hair
        * systemic illness/ history of head tauma/ pelvic trauma
        * infection past history of mumps orchitis/ STIs/ genitourinary tract infections
        * surgical procedures (eg vasectomy/ orchiectomy)
        * drugs (smoking and alcohol, chemo, drugs that cause hyperprolactinaemia)
        * examination: androgen deficiency (micropenis, loss of 2ndary sexual characteristics, or Tanner stage less than 5, orchidometer to determine teseticular volumes)
    + Investigations
        * Semen analysis
            - semen volume and pH
            - microscopy:

                + debris and agglutination
                + leuk count
                + immature germ cells
        * @low sperm count %follow with testosterone to look for klinefelter's syndrome

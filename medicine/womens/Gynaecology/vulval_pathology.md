[lichen; from the greek tree moss, unknown why called this but named long ago, potentially thought was @fungus. however in this context means leathery - hardenning of the skin @chronic inflammation with characteristic surface markings]
# Dermatoses
- Lichen sclerosus (LS); hardening
    + 1 in 80 women affected
    + most common vulval disorder, lifelong condition
    + ?@autoimmune disease, assoc with certain HLA subtypes.
    + more common @peri/ postmenopausal women >50
    + clinical
        * 20% asymptomatic
        * pruritic vulvae, occurs periodically, resovle spontaneously every few weeks.
        * white (leukoplakia) scaly lesion with thin skin
        * %extensive fibrosis/ inflammation == fusion of th labia majora and labia minora ("labial resorption") == difficult sexual penetration and burying of the clitoris
        * %extends to include the perianal skin == pruritis ani
    + associated with differentiated VIN/ vulval carcinoma (5% lifetime risk of Ca)
    + treatment
        * high dose local corticosteroid ointment PRN, then preventative
        * avoidance of irritants
- Lichen simplex chronicus (LSC)
    + 2nd most common vulval lesion
    + well circumscribed lesions, can occur other parts of the body
    + usu @chronic contract dermatitis/ emotional stress
    + usu majora affected, usu bilateral
    + clinical:
        * licehnification, hardening of vulval areas
    + treat:
        * well treaeted with local steroids, %recurrence
        * avoidance of irritants eg soaps/ pads/ panty liners
- Lichen planus (LP)
    + far less common than LS, but also an autoimmune condition and lifelong and often affects the vagina/ vulva
    + often assoc with LP of the mouth
    + clinical
        * vulval pain + ulceration
        * chronic vaginal discharge
        * rust colored patched on teh vulva and vagina %with ulceration and are extremely tender
    + treatment
        * low dose long term corticosteroids sytemically
        * %@not respond == requires oral methotrexate/ azathioprine
    + similar risk to LS in developing carcinoma -- 5%
- psoriasis
    + usu with systemic effect, appears somewhat different. still has salmon border but is not as scaly.


# Other Painful conditions of vulva
- Bartholin duct abscess/ cyst
    + @obstruction to Bartholin usu @trauma == cystic swelling at 4 or 8 oclock.
    + 2.5 cm long duct, the abscess forms in teh duct.
    + %requires GA and drainage with marsupialisation to allow fro continuous drainage.
- Herpes genitalis
    + clusters of painful vesicles, form superficical ulcers and are acquire d@sexual contact. 
    + oral antivrirals to treat
    + continuous low dose oral antivirals can used proph @recurrent episodes.
- Plasma cell (Zoon's) vulvitis
    + less common than LP, similar clinical presentation
    + painful erythematous lesions throught vulva and vagina
    + autoimmune with ++plasma cells on histo
    + treat @topical vulva/ intravaginal high potency steroid creams
- Cicatricial pemphigoid
    + iimmunobullous condition
    + ++painful superficial epidermal blisters through vulva. 
    + treat@systemic steroid thgerapy and ++pain control
- vulval ulcers
    + aphthous ulcers usu @stress, respond well to topical high potency corticosteroid cream. @chronic ulcer with basal fibrosis == will not clear and require surgery
    + %get Behcet's disease (solitary painful vulval ulcer) associated with oral ulceration. systemic disease
- vulvodynia
    + chronjic vulval disorder with burning pain iin absence of visislbe findings. vulva looks normal. usu after trauma eg @sexual
    + usu secondary vaginismus @involutnary introital muscle spasm

# Infections
- Candida albicans most cmmon cause
    + ==heavy vaginal discharge cottage cheese
    + intense pruritis of vulva with erythema and swelling
    + 20% of women have candida without symptoms
    + recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis @4+ episodes of candid @12 month period. usu @prolonged BSAs + stress/ diabetes
- tinea
    + extends to groins and presens with itchy well circumscribed rythematous rash with central clearing (as opose to psoriaiss)
        * use terbinafine/ clotrimazole
- bacterial vaginosis
    + overgrowth of natural bacteria with loss of lactobacilli. 
    + malodorous discharge ++@++sexual intercourse
    + intravaginal clindamycin OR IntraVaginal/PO metronidazole 


# Atrophic vaginitis
- inflammation fo vagina @low estrogen levels usu @perimenopausse. 
- @low lactobacilli == low acidity == overgrowth of bacteria aand superinfection == increaasedd discharge and symptoms of burning/ irritation/ pain (BV)
- treat with topical estrogen into the vagina either cream/ pessary. this will treat bth vaginal and vulval symptoms as well as stop infection

# Foreign body
- causes offenseive intractable offensive discharge
- often found sex toys/ condoms
- @children most common is concretion of tp

# Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis (DIV)
- intractable vaginal dishcarge, usu perimenopause
- thought to eb autoimmeun disease
- treat @long term intravaginal creams such as clindamycin (an abx + antiinflammatory effects) and hydrocortisone

###### Cancerous lesions of the vulva
    Carcinoma of the vulva


- Carcinoma of the vulva
    + rf
        * most common postmenopause
        * HPV infection (wart subtypes)

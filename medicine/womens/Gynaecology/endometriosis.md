###### Endometriosis

# Endometriosis
    estrogen dependent benign condition where endometrial glands and stroma found outside endometrial cavity causing menstrual cycle dependent cramping, dyspareunia, %constipation and subfertility.
    10% affected. 
    diagnosis difficult, gold standard is laparoscopy.
- medical
    + affected sites
        * ++affects the broad ligaments A and P, uterosacral ligaments, ovaries. 
        * posterior vagina
        * bowel
        * bladder
        * ovaries most common location
        * 30% peritoneum of the pouch of douglas
    + complicationshs:
        * ++associated with infertility due to toxic environment for oocyte, blockage of fallopian tubes @adhesions, malformation of uterus, decreased sex @dyspareunia
        * rectal involvement (full thickness)
        * bladder endometriosis
        * malignant change is very rare
    + pathology
        * endometrioma (ovarian lesion): formed @ectopic endometrial tissue bleeds == hematoma surrounded by duplicated ovarian parenchyma
        * lesion color correlates with age of lesion
            - clear/red (early), black (peritoneum infiltrated), white (fibrosis/ late lesions)
    + staging
        * 1-4 (minimal to severe)
        * often extent of disease does not correlate with patient reported severity of symptoms
    + prognosis
        * depends on severity, often recurs within years. pregnancy may have a slowing effect on recurrence.
- clinical
    + history
        * usu present in reproductive years peak 25-35 
        * %adnexal mass (may feel pressure)
        * 25%infertility
        * %%low back pain
        * %%chronic fatigue
        * menstrual dependent:
            - 80% pelvic pain 
                + chronic, can be dull, throbbing, sharp, bruning. 
            - dysmenorrhoea (dull/crampy pelvic pain that begins 1-2 days before menses and continues for days after menses)
            - %irregular periods
            - dyspareunia (indicative of deeply infiltrating endometriosis)
            - %sx of involvement of other sites:
                + bladder involvement (urgerny, frequency, haematuria), %ureteral involvement
                + bowel involvement (dyschezia)
    + examination   
        * bimanual reveals tenderness, fixation and nodularity of the pouch of douglas. %tenderness of uterosacral ligaments
        * mainly just tnderness to palpation on examination
- investigations
    + preop high resolution USS can produce accurate findings.
    + MRI - good for diagnosing deep infiltrating endometriosis of bowel
    + laparoscopy -- gold standard for diagnosis. %with colorectal surgeon present to @presence of rectal involvement.
- Rx
    + medical management (for women who do not desire fertility @these treatmnts will further decrease fertility)
        * NSAIDs == reduce PGs == -=contractions == -=pain
        * hormone treatments
            - COCP/progestins/ depot/ progesterone implant == -=endometrial proliferation/ -=ovulation
        * Danazol (suppresses HPO axis)
            - steroid hormone inhibits ovulation and suppresses menstruation
            - infrequently used @androgenic side effects
            - androgenic side effects @acne, edemea, weieght gain, hirsutism, hair loss and voice change, hot flushes, menstrual irregularity.
        * Aromatase inhibitors (-=androgens converted to estrogen)
        * GnRH analogues (-=HPA == -=gonadotropins)
    + surgical (especially when fertility is desired surgery is performed @medications are contaceptive)
        * laparoscopic surgery to remove lsions. %with urology/ colorectal present @distant sites of involvement.
        * %ovarian cystectomy, peritonectomy
        * treatment with GnRH anlogue for 3 months before surgery is often used.
        * 50% of women may require followup surgery @recurrence of endometriosis. 
        * usu use postoperative medical managmenet (eg with COCP or LNG Mirena) to delay symptom recurrence

###### Pelvic organ prolapse
- basics
    + organs that prolapse: bladder, rectum, pouch of douglas and small bowel @weakness in the pelvic floor (@ligaments, fasica, musculature waekness caused @denervation, ++abdo pressure, hormonal deficiency)
- anatomy   
    + pelvis
    + normal support @connective tissue (endopelvic fascia), pelvic floor muscles (levator ani - PR, ). 
    + condensation of CT with parietal fascia called the arcus tendineus formed 
    + 3 layers of support
        * level 1 (uppermost support): supports upper vagina and uterine cervix to latero-posterior pelvis. Supported @cardinal-uterosacral ligaments
        * level 2: 
            - endopelvic fascia
            - lateral (paravaginal) support of the bladder, middle 2 quarters of the vagina and rectum
        * level 3:
            - deep support near perineal body, fusion of lower vagina to perineal membrane
            - support lower quarter of vagina and rectum
- types of prolapse
    + anterior vaginal wall descent - cystocele
    + apircal descent - uterine/ vault prolapse, enterocele
    + posterior vaginal wall descent - rectocele
    + procidentia (inversion of the vaginal cavity externally)
    + urethral prolapse (through urehtral meatus)
    + rectal prolapse (rectum through anus)
- medical
    + complications
        * posterior wall tear %== constipation @obstruction of rectal opening
        * evisceration @perforation of pelvic viscus
    + associations
        * %associated with FI/ UI @underlying tear
- risk factors:
    + past pregnancy (esp vaginal delivery/ instrumented delivery)
    + age
    + menopause @estrogen deficiency
    + previous pelvic surgery/ hysterectomy
    + obesity (++abdo pressure)
    + congential defects (collagen dysfunction syndromes)
    + high impact activities/ heavy lifting
- clinical
    + usu referred by GP, eg after pap-smear is taken
    + history
        * often asymptomatic init
        * sensation of bulge out of vagina
        * %assoc with UI/ constipation/ FI
        * %worried about physical appearance
    + examination (supine, knees bent, labia parted, look at each compartment of the vaginal canal)
        * perineum inspection
            - dove tail sign (lack of rugae around anal sphincter between 11 and 1 o clock)
        * coughs/ pushing (detect furhter prolapse)
        * bivalve speculum (cervix vis)
        * sims speculum  (left lateral position, easier to assess prolapse)
        * rectal examination (may show posterior wall prolapse causing obstruction to rectum)
- assessment/ classification
    + Baden walker not used as much
    + POP-Q
        * cm in reference to the hymenal ring remnant, 6 mobile points, measured @max Valsalva, and 3 fixed points at rest
- management
    + conservative vs. surgical (immediate indicated @procicdentia or total apical eversion)
    + asymptomatic
        * PF PT
        * general advice about lifestyle to decrease risk of presentation
    + symptomatic
        * address other medical issues which may be contributing
        * non pharma
            - PF PT
            - avoid exercises that worsen it
        * pharma
            - @post-menopausal == local estrogen (eg ovestin cream @low absorption). also help other symptoms of vaginal dryness etc.
            - pessary (ring, ring with support), inert silicon to offer support. help with UI. SE: UTI, vaginal infections, erosions, discharge. ring can be managed by self. sits just under cervix, excellent for anterior wall/ uterus. not as good @posterior wall.
            - discuss with onc/ surgeon @past history of Breast Ca
        * surgical
            - either via the vagina OR abdominally. vaginally preferred @primary prolapse
            - cystocele (anterior colporrhapy)
            - rectocele (posterior colporrhapy)
            - uterine prolapse (hysteropexy -- resupporting with mesh/ suture)
            - complications
                + mesh exposure (bladder erosion, vagina wall erosion)

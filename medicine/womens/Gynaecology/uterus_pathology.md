###### Uretus pathology

# Adenomyosis
    endomertrial glands extend in myometrium. 
    1/3 of women
    common @>40 yrs old. 
    more common @multiparous - opposite to leiomyoma
    has been argued that its a normal variant, symptoms attributed to co-incident endometriosis

    + COCP/ mirena
    + surgery difficult, planes less clear for removal than fibroid. %hysterectomy if fertility not needed.


# Leiomyoma (fibromyomas aka fibroids)
    very common benign tumor, aka fibroids
    20% women affected
    grow during reproductive years, as menopause approaches they become larger and %symptomatic
    %atrophy after menopause @loss of estrogen stimulation, but may stay large. 
    cannot clinically distinguish from leiomyomsarcoma, must use histo sample

        * <8cm diameter, if asymptomatic no removal needed. annual assessment of gorwth made. if pregnancy planned some will recommend doing prophylactic removal, but C-section scar carries risks as well

        * radiology myomectomy (embolisation of vessel supplying fibroid). risk of infection of necrotic fibroid

# Amenorrhoea
- primary Amenorrhoea: failure of spontaneous menstruation to occur by 16 yrs age, OR by age 15 @absence of secondary sex characteristics
    + incindence of 0.1-0.3%
- secondary Amenorrhoea: absence of menstruation >6 months duration in woman who previously menstruated. 
- oligomenorrhoea: reduced freq periods with cycles 6 weeks to 6 months
- hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism: reduced ovarian function (hypogonadism) w/ low levels of stimulating hormones in the ovary. == -=estrogen / progesterone w/ low FSH and LH

# Puberty
- menarche usu @12-13 within 3 years of breast development
- Tanner breast stage IV around the time of
- by age 15, 98% will have had menses.

# Secondary Amenorrhoea
    pregnancy
    PCOS 
    Hypothalamic amenorrhoea (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism)

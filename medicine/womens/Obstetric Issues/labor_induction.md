###### Induction of labor
    25% of pregnancies end in IOL
    risk of neonatal prematurity on delivery @fetal lung dysfx

# Contraindications
- @head high and mobile = small risk of cord prolapse (should do CS)
- Cervical score (Bishops score). a ripe cervix increases chance of uncomplicated VD following IOL
- contraindications to vaginal delivery (active vaginal HSV, vasa praevia, placental praevia, malpresentation, previous C-sections relative CI)

# Common indications
- FGR
- DM
- Post dates pregnancy
- Hypertensive disorders
    + Pre-eclampsia 
    + Chronic essential hypertension
    + Gestational hypertension
- Other medical conditions
    + Liver disease
    + Renal disease
    + Cholestasis of pregnancy
    + Red cell isoimmunisation
    + Thrombophilia
    + Anticoagulation in pregnancy
    + Substance abuse
- FGR/ PI
- PROM (pre-labor ROM)
- Multiple pregnancy
- APH with normal placenta location
- Partner availability
- Long standing infertility to minimise risks

# Assessment prior to IOL
- Fetal wellbeing
- Bishops score
    + PECDS: uses cervical dilation, effacement, position, consistency, station of the presenting part
    + max score 13, but 5 or less is considered unripe and would benefit from ripening

# Cervical ripening
- indicated @bishops score <=5. not required otherwise.
- methods
    + pharmacological (prostaglandin analogue)
        * options
            - intravaginal Prostaglanding E2 Dinoprostone "prostin" gel
                + 1mg initially followed by another dose 6 hrs later @still unripe. %use a third dose.
            - slow release pessary
                + release slow 4mg of Dinoprostone over 12 hr period. 
                + string attached allows removal @hyperstimulation
            - misoprostol used for T2 induction of labor
        * may induce labor itself, however ARM or other augmentation methods may be needed.
        * risks
            - precipitate labor
            - uterine hyperstimulation (>5 in 10 mins or each >70 seconds) == fetal hypoxia/ acidotic
            - uterine rupture/ amniotic fluid embolus
        * contraindications
            - rf for uterine rupture (grandmultiparity, prev uterine scar @CS)
            - known PI or fetal hypoxia that could worsen @tachysystole.
    + mechanical (transcervical catheter inflation)
        * saline inflation 30mL foley catheter usu done overnight
        * risks
            - infection (CA)
        
# Monitoring
- regardless of method used continuous CTG monitoring is required @all methods have direct/ indirect effects on fetal wellbeing

# Rupture of membranes
    ARM/ AROM
    works @increasing release of endogenous prostaglandings == ++uterine muscular activity
    allows pressure directed downwards == ferguson reflex (further release of oxytocin @compression of uterine muscle)
- method
    + aseptic technique
    + AmniHook/ alligator forceps
    + more difficult @lower cervical score
    + after, check for cord prolapse and FHR
    + @more liquor than expected == keep hand in to allow the liquor to be released slowly 
- contraindications
    + high presenting part (risk of cord prolapse)
    + infection

# Oxytocin infusion to induce labor
- infusion 
    + starting dose 12 ml/hr, increased by 12 units until regular contractions of moderate intensity 4 every 10 minutes or good progress of labor (1 cm/ hr). 
    + commence at a lower dose @prostaglandins already used for ripening
    + only change the dose once every 30 minutes @takes time for oxytocin levels to reach steady state
    + maintain infusion for 1 hour to maintain tone after delivery
- risks
    + uterine hyperstimulation (more likely @already using prostaglandins for the cervical ripening)
    + hypotension
    + water intoxication
    + PPH (downregulation of receptor == reduced sensitivity to oxytocin esp @high levels used).

# Complications of IOL
- uterine tachysystole
- uterine rupture and Amniotic fluid embolus
- fetal hypoxia


# Uterine tachysystole (uterine hyperstimulation)
    high frequency of contractions leading to fetal hypoxia. 
    oftne considered @>4 contractions per 10 minutes
- treatment
    + acute tocolysis
        * IV salbutamol
        * SC terbutaline (b2 adrenergic agonist)
        * SL GTN
- complications
    + precipitate labor

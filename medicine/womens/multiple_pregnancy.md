###### Multiple pregnancy
    twins: risk is pretty much doubled for everything in relation to pregnancy. in some areas even higher (eg prematurity is 6x more likely.)
    most important is to determine chorionicity to predict outcomes and manage.
- classification
    + zygosity:
        * 2/3 are dizygotic (independent fertilisation of 2 ovulated oocytes). always dichorionic.
        * 1/3 are monozygotic (cleavage of single fertilised oocyte)
    + chorionicity / amnionicity
        * dichorionic diamnotic: very early cleavage <4 days post fert. 1/3 of MZ twins. separate placenta, separate sacs.
        * monochorionic diamenotic: cleavage of MZ pregnancy btwen 4-8 days post fert. shared placenta with separate sacs. most common, approx 2/3 of MZ twins
        * monochorionic monoamniotic: cleavage 8-12 post fert. 1% of MZs. 
        * conjoined: @cleavage of MZ pregnancy after day 12. +++rare. 
- epid
    + rf
        * increasing parity, increase maternal age, use of reproductive technologies (IVF)
- investigations
    + USS diagnose twins, and determine amnionicity, chorionicity. 
- rx
    + increased symptmos associated with prengnacy


# Monochorionic twins
- monitoring
    + should be monitored every 2-3 weeks from 12 weeks to determine TTTS presence.
- TTS (twin to twin transfusion syndrome)
    + @unbalanced vascular communications == donor twin becomes hypovaolaemia, hypotensive, anuric == anyhydramnios. the recipient twins = polyhydramnios and hgh output cardiac failure. 
    + usually fatal for both @not terated
    + treated @fetoscopic lazer photocoagulation fot eh placental vessels.

###### Woman incontinence

# Urinary incontinence
- epidemiology
    + 8-9% of all women, 12% of all women 65+. 
- anatomy
    + bladder extraperitoneal, close to SP anteriorly and vagina/ cervix posterior. supported @anterior vaginal wall and levator ani (pelvic floor). 
    + transitional epithelium superficial to detrusor muscles. exterior adventitia/ serosa
- physiology
    + hypogastric nerve @distention of bladder == pudendal outflow
    + storage @SANS hypogastric nerve (T10-L2) beta receptors == detrusor relaxes and sphincters contract @alpha receptors. inhibits pudendal.
    + eliminiation @PANS M2/M3 pudendal nerve (S2/4) == contraction of detrusor, relax of sphincter
    + PMC (pointe micturition centre) stimulation == stimulation of SANS == storage. Inhibition == inhibitino of SANS, and activations of PANS == elimiation.
    + Bladder control @infant is the spinal reflex arc == invol voiding.
- classification (think of problem of bladder tank and bladder tap - the sphincter)
    + stress
    + overflow
    + urgency
    + mixed (stress + urge)
    + functional
    + continuous
- urethral diverticulum
    + below sphincter @pockets in urehtra == urine accumulates and released @standing
- clinical
    + history
        * %assocaited with prolapse
        * %dysuria/ haematuria (eg exclude UTI, cancer)
        * bowel symptoms
        * labor/ gynae history
        * med history (eg ask for narrow angle glaucoma)
    + examination   
        * cough/ valsalva (Stress incontinence)
- managemnet
    + non pharma
        * avoid mild diuretics (alcohol, tea, coffee)
        * eg. inconitinence pessaries (the nob increase the force on teh internal sphincter)
        * PF PT
        * pads
    + surgical
        * vaginal mesh still available @incontinence (@actually has low morbidity assoc)
        * urethral sling procedures (open to revision in the next couple of weeks if there is retention)
            - retropubic slings
            - transobturator slings
            - pubovaginal slings (requires suturing, worse symptoms after, difficult to get right pressure)
        * bursh colposuspension
            - dissect between bladder and posterior aspect of the PS. place sutures in periurethral tissue into coopers ligament == tightening and support of urethra
        * periurethral bulking injections
            - failed other surgeries for UI. or CI for more invasive surgery. however the midurethral slings is very well tolerated so less used now
- investigations
    + all patients  
        * UTI screen esp @old/ recurrent UTIs
        * PRV (esp for urinary retention in the event of overflow UI)
        * bladder diary (always give @often misrecall)
    + more discerning -- @patients failing conserv. rx or complex sx
        * urodynamics (saline to fill bladder) -- can see neurological causes
        * video urodynamics (contrast, image study)
        * cystourethroscopy (look for urethral internal sphincter closure issues). important @surge prep
- managment
    + anticholinergics: oxybutynin (trasnderal and oral preps)
    + M3 (thus specific to the bladder)
        * Darifenacin, Solifenacin 
    + Beta-3 agonist: mirabegron, facilitates relaxation of detrusor
    + interventional
        * cystocscopy with hydrodistension
        * botox injection
        * percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation
        * sacral nerve simulation (for intractable OAB, more invasive)
        * other urological procedures as last resort: bladder augmentation surgery, urinary diversion

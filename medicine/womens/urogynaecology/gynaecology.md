- endometrial sampling
    + indicated @presenting @abnormal uterine bleeding/ women high risk of endometrial cancer
    + CI @acute cervical/ uterine infections or suspected pregnancy
    + procedure
        * visualise the cervix with speculum and pass pipelle or rocket endomeetrial smapling device through the internal os
        * %use a tenaculum after spraying the cervix with local anaesthetic to reduce discomfort
- hysteroscopy
    + gold standard diagnose cause of abnormal uterine bleeding
    + indicated @AUB, endometrial thickening, submucosal fiibroids, mullerian anomalies, intrauterine adhesions, RPOC
    + CI @viable intrauterine pregnancy, active pelvic infection, known cervical/ uterine cancer
- diagnostic laparoscopy
    + lap and dye
        * methylene blue is introduced into the tubes to determine patency as visualised until it spills out of the tubule ostia. may be used to determine female fertility.
- hysterosalpingogram
    + fluoroscopy with dye through uterus to determine shape of the tuerus and fallopoian tubes. can see tubal rupture, can be used to diagnose tubal patency issue and rupture
- saline sonohysterography
    + saline introduced into uterus to visualise endometrium more lcearly. easily see polyps/ postmenopasual endometrium

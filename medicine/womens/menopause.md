###### Menopause
    The menopause: end of reproductive life (marked by the final menstrual period -- in contrast to menarche). 
    <40 premature
    <45 early
    HRT will be used @premature menopause/ early menopause more likely, but @normal age, less likely to use HRT
- menarche: determined @adiposity and birth weight

# Definitions
- menopause transition (paramenopause)
    + new onset of menstrual cycle change +/- vasomotor symptoms
- postmenopause 
    + more than 12 months after the final menstrual period
    + woman considered postmenopausal @12 months after the final period
- surgical menopause

# Physiology
- occurs @exhaustion of primordial follicles are exhausted. the primordial follicles are 95% lost during gestation
- follicles decrease with age, with accelerated rate after 37 years
- perimenopausal hormonal changes:
    + @day2-6 in the early follicular stage, measure FSH. if >20 then perimenopausal, if >40 then postmenopasual
    + measuring this is not usually useful for at age menopausal women
- age of menopause
    + smokers have menopause 1-2 years earlier (directly toxic to the primordial follicles)
    + hysterectomy == reduced age of menopausal symptom onset (but difficult to diagnose through menstrual bleeding)

# Symptoms
- vasomotor symptoms 
    + hot flushes/ night sweats (same mechanism). 80-90% of women. 20% severe enough to require treatment.
    + usu transient, most severe in the first year menopause. but usu last 4-10 yrs. 40% get severe symptoms even 10 years after.
- vaginal dryness 40-60%
    + -=estradiol, thus starts @older age. persists during postmenopausal life. affects sexual activity.
- sleep disturbance 40-60%
    + could be partially @hot flushes
    + 
- mood disturbance 30%
    + thought to be mostly @sleep disturbance/ other symptoms

# Premature menopause
- considered premature <40, and early <45.
- etiology (overwhelmingly iatrogenic)
    + spontaneous (about 1% of women)
    + premature ovarian failure
    + iatrogenic cuases (chemotherapy/ radiotherapy/ surgery)
        * ++likelihood @eg BMT/ chemo == menopause
- implications
    + ++risk of Osteoporosis (++time without estrogen == ++bone resorption)
    + altered body image
    + ++depression
    + loss of fertility (esp @sudden menopause == cannot conceive) --  however still a chance so use contraception still
- management
    + HRT required up until the average age of menopause

# Early menopause
- <45, 5% of women

# Osteoporosis
- lifestyle intervetions

# Treatment of menopause
- vasomotor symptoms (highest morbidity symptom)
    + CBT (reduces problem rating of vasomotor sx by 80%). ids triggers and reduces anxiety that it causes. improves mood and anxiety.
    + more effective than venlafaxine
    + %%hypnotherapy, as it can be successful.
    + pharmacotherapy: 
        * SSRIs, SNRIs, Anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabilin and clonidine)
- vaginal dryness
    + vaginal estrogen. ultra low dose. improves symptoms and does not increse systemic estrogen levels.


# HRT
- estrogen + progestogen. progestogen added to prevent endometrium hyperstimulation. (post hysterectomy only need E)
- is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms
- risks
    + combined HRT (estrogen + progestin) actually associated with breast cancer. (despite reducing the risk of uterine cancer @presence of progesterone)
    + increased risk of VTE and stroke
    + increased CVD in older women
- contraindications
    + personal history fo breast cancer
    + previous TE event or inherited thrombophilia
    + cardio/ cerebroascular disease
    + acute liver siase
    + uncontrolled HTN
    + abormal vaginal bleeding
    + active gallbladder disease
    + smoker/ obesity (relative CI)
- benefits
    + reduces freq and severity of vasomotor symptoms (75-85%) == improves sleep
    + imrpoves vaginal dryness
    + maintains bone density and reduces frature risk
- routes of administration
    + oral
    + patches
    + gel (local for atrophic vaginiitis)
    + intrauterine (progestogen)



# What doesn't work?
- relaxation/ mindfulness
- paced breathing
- dietary modifications
- vitamin suplements
- yoga/ acupuncture

# Other alternatives
- tibolone (but not as effective as HRT)

# future treatments
- NK3 antagonists (may allow opposition of hot flushes)
- stllate ganlgion block

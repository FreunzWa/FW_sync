###### Obesity and diabetes in pregnancy

# Complications and risks of increased BMI
    miscarriage
    NTDs
    GDM
    Macrosomia 
    Pre-Eclampsia and HTN
    Macrosomia
    Need for induction (high rate of post-dates)
    Failure to progress in labor (-=vol and freq of contractions)
    Shoulder dystocia
    C-section 
        infection
        lactation difficulties (also breasts may be too big)

# Recommendations prepregnancy
- weight gain
    + 40+BMI (gain <6.7 kg)
    + 30-40 BMI (gain 6-11)
    + normal gain 10 kg.
- folate supplementation double - 5mg 



# Models of care in obesity and diabetes
- @BMI 30-40, then obstetrician hospital based care
- Diabetes - requires
    + endocrinologist
    + dietician
    + obstetrician
    + diabetes educator


# Screening @elevated BMI
- 12 week nuchal scan
- 16 week OGTT
    + trying to pick up underlying metabolic syndrome
- 20 week morphology scan
- 28 week OGTT
- 30-32 week US growth

# Intrapartum considerations
- see an anaesthetist
    + delay in regional anaesthetisia
        * @distorted anatomy
        * longer needle required
        * increased risk of higher block (thoracic block @reverse trendelenberg == resp compromise and risk of death)

# Diabetes management
- BSLs
    + fasting + 2 hours post-prandials (as oppose to before, because the sugar peaks drive macrosomia)
    + insulin requirements increases linearly each week in pregnancy
    + targets
        * <5 for fasting
        * <6.7 for post-prandial
- IOL
    + induced at 38 weeks for increasing insulin requirements OR for falling insulin requirements (indicates placental failure)

###### First trimester pregnancy problems
    First trimester issues are considered gynaecological issues rather than obstetrics issues.




# bHCG in pregnancy
- bHCG produced @trophoblastic tissue (eg @ectopic, normal pregnancy, tumor, multiple pregnancy). thus bHCG does not inform what is happening @the pregnancy. 
- bHCG usu doubles every 48 hours in a normal pregnancy during weeks 4-8. then plateau, then the placenta takes over production of bHCG from the corpus luteum. @no longe rincrase in bHCG == resolution of some of pregnancy related symptoms

# USS and early pregnancy
- <1500 bHCG dont really expect to see anything in the uterus, but %indicated for concerning features/ pain
- scan findings in early pregnancy (TV USS is the gold standard at this stage due to difficulty in seeing structures, also @false negative on TA due to superimposition). GA by LMP
    + <5 weeks 
        * %see gestational sac
        * bHCG < 1500
    + 5-6 weeks
        * gestational sac, %see yolk sac TV
        * bHCG 1500-3500
    + 7 weeks
        * 5-10 mm embryo, TV can see %cardiac activity
        * bHCG 20,000
        
# EPAS
    early pregnancy assessment service
- multidisciplinary clinic for rx and follow up of early pregnancy problems. 
- introduced @10-15 years ago in Australia.

# Bleeding in early pregancy
- EP until proven otherwise

# Miscarriage
    loss of pregnnacy <20 weeks, not @abortion. otherwise stillbirth.
    @miscarriage between 12-20 weeks, suggests possible structural abnormality.
    1/4 - 1/5 chance of miscarriage (in all pregnancies occurs 15-20%)
- 30% pregnancy will have bleeding, does not mean miscarriage. 
- 50% @threatened miscarriage == continuing pregnancy
- types
    + threatened miscarriage: PC@bleeding + see live pregnancy
    + incomplete: some POC present, cervix open or closed. Pain/ PV bleeding ongoing. 
    + septic miscarriage: @sx of infection, pain/ bleding ongoing. usu @instrumentation. POC absent.
    + complete miscarriage: cervix closed, US shows empty uterus. pain and PV bleeding (POC)
- causes:
    + ++%chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidy etc.)
    + maternal illness (diabetes, thyroid disesae, APS, lupus)
    + lifestyle factors (smoking, diabetes, alcohol, caffeine)
    + trauma (DV is a prominent cause)
    + cervical incompetence/ uterine abnormalities (eg bicornate uterus) -- but usu 12-20 weeks miscarriage. hysterosalpingogram to investigate structural abns.
- HEI
    + examination
        * @PV bleeding == PV examination to visualise the cervix
    + investigations
        * bHG
        * FBE: haemoglobin
        * group adn cross match if there is hypovolaemia, rhesus grouping
        * USS
            - predictors of failing pregnancy: slowing FHR, subchorionic haematoma, abrnoaml yolk sac, abnormal gestation sac
- management of miscarriage
    + misoprostol to encourage extrusion of POC
    + %surgical to move the POC (especially when the POC are larger)

# Recurrent miscarriage
    3+ miscarriages consec (in a row!)
    1% of women
- @loss of 3 or more consecutive prengnancies requires investigation and referral

# Pregnancy of unknown location
    rising bHCG, with no obvious intrauterine pregnancy. not yet an ectopic pregnancy, but should be considered as such until proven otherwise.
- 15-20% of pregnancies are PUL @EPAU

# Ectopic pregnancy
    11 per 1000 pregnancies. increasing @IVF.
    must have very high level of suspicion for EP, esp @
- risk factors
    + nulliparous
    + pregnant, obviously
    + PID
    + more severe @lower SE status @lower access to early pregnancy scans. @higher SE == more likely get dating scan, so more likely to find.
- medical
    + more likely ~93% at the ampulla. 
    + more likely to rupture @isthmic locatoin due to anastomosis of vessels == extreme bleeding 
- clinical
    + acute abdomen
    + vaginal bleeding
    + adnexal tenderness
    + hypovolaemic sx
    + shoulder tip pain
- investigations
    + POC USS (empty uterus, adnexal mass)
    + serum bHCG (if not rising properly i.e. doubling, the bHCG cannot rise properly @cannot embed appropriately into the endometrium)
    + surgical (diagnostic laparotomy -- rule out appendicitis)
    + FBE/ Group and antivodies
- DDx
    + appendicitis 
    + UTI
    + ovarian cyst
    + utereteric stone
    + GI
    + MSK (of sxclusion)
- management
    + conservative, seldom done
        * if HCG <1000 and dropping, and no pain, and will represent @reliable. 
    + medicla
        * MTX @no FH. 
        * folinic acid blocker == stops developing pregnancy. must be asymptoatic. must be no contraindication to MTX.
        * especialy @previously had surgery and lost a tube.
    + surgical
        * salpingectomy
        * salpingostomy
        * small reduction in fertility but the remaining tube will compensate. (if taken 2nd tube then only option remains IVF.)

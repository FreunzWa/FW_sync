###### Hypertension in pregnancy
    gestational hypertension -- HTN developnig @pregnancy but without systemic effects. 10% of pregnancies. 
    prec unique to pregnancy. appears @20 weeks GA, disappearing within days of delivery. 

# Classifciaation of HTN in pregnancy
- SBP >140 OR DBP > 90 (Korotkoff V). Severe (>S:160 OR D:110)
- classes
    + chronic hypertension: HTN in pregnancy before 20 WG
    + gestational HTN: HTN in pregnancy >20 WG @prev normotensive
    + Pre-eclampsia: HTN >20 WG @prev normotesive with evidence of systemic involvement. 

# Chronic HTN
- 1-2%, either primary or secondary. most @primary idiopathic HTN
- stop diuretics and ACEi, replace with safe
- %exacerbation of HTN, risk of prec and placental abruption
- usu early delivery is indicated

# Gestational hypertension
- 10% prevalence
- rf
    + obesity
- rx
    + monitor for systemic involvement with PreC features
    + usu indicated induced labor @38-40 weeks

# Pre-eclampsia
    unique to pregnancy, commences ~20 weeks and disappears within days of delivery.
    Hypertension > 20WG + evidence of systemic involvement.
    1 in 50 pregnancies.
- basics
    + mild-severe. usu indicate induction of labor and early delivery. @severe == intensive management.

- medical
    + mx 
        * ?cause of placenta hypoxia4 == factor released from placenta == widespread endothelial dysfunction == placental ischaemia == the placenta attempts to drive up blood pressure to maintain its supply  
        * @widespread endothelial dysfunction == generalised vasospasm and capillary permeability, widespread tissue ischeamia, platelet aggregation + microthrombus formation.
        * reduced repsonse to vasodilators (NO), hypersenstiviity to circulating vasoconstrictors
    + theories:
        * @immunological mechanisms == insufficient invasion of the spiral vessels into the placenta to become low resistance vessels.
    + etiologies
        * hyperplacentosis (a large placenta @multipple pregnancy)
        * previous vascular disease

- features
    + HTN >20WG + systemic involvement marked @:
        * Renal: proteinuria/ renal insufficiency/ uric acid accumulation
        * Haematological: thrombocytopaenia/ DIC
        * Hepatic: elevated TAs, RUQ pain
        * Neurological: convulsions, hyperreflexia + sustained clonus, blurred vision @ishcamiea of the retinal artery @widespread vasospasm
        * Pulmonary: edema
        * Placental: abruption, FGR
        * Cardiovascular: generalised edema

- management
    + depends on the GA, severity of Pre-eclampsia and fetal wellbeing. 
    + severity classification
        * determined @degree of symptoms, fetal condition and blood pressure. 
        * mild PreC
            - should be monitored 1/ 2 times weekly for symptoms and clinical features (blood pressure)
            - rx with antihypertensives (methyldopa, labetalol / nifedipine)
            - delivery @38 weeks or earlier @evidence of fetal compromise
        * severe PreC
            - 5 things (convulsion prophylaxis, blood pressure monitoring and treatment, fetal assessment, haem/liver/renal function test)
            - intensive observation
            - almost always early delivery needed (evidence of end organ damage signs is absolute indication regardless of GA)
            - short term blood pressure control (hydralazine/ nifedipine can be used, esp @>160/ 110)
            - fluid assessment: often intravascular dry @fluid extravasation due to leaky capillaries == give colloid/ crystalloid fluid bolus (esp indicate @low JVP pressure). usu get a CVP line before @risk of exacerbating pulmonary edema. 
            - FFP %required @severe platelet fysfunction
            - anticonvulsant prophylaxis
                + magnesium sulphate
            - fetal surveillance
            - C-section only required @fetal distress, breech, APH, unfavorable cervix. @blood pressure very high then prolonged pushing is CId.   
                + Ergotremine CI'd @3rd stage

    + similar to Preclampsia, but more focus on haematological and biochemical disturbances


# Eclampsia
    generalised TC seziures @prengnacy related cerebral hypoxia and vasospasm/ edema
    very high risk of death to mother and babys
- occurs in 1 in 1500 pregnancies. pregnancies. 
- 50% occurs around labor, 50% very soon after labor. %%%prior to onset of labor

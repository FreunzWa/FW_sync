###### Nutrient deficiency neurological disorders

# Wernicke encephalopathy
- basics
    + alcoholic brain disease characterised by subacute development of neurologial symptoms
    + common acute neurological encephalopathy @thiamine (vitB1) deficiency
    + classic triad of oculomotor dysfx, gait ataxia, encephalopathic sx
    + late stage == korsakoff syndrome (id @presence of aterograde/ retrograde amnesia). %WE episode may be subclinical and KS may develop. KS can have permanent implications for cognition
    + ++@AUD. 
    + recommend 1.1-1.2 mg daily of thiamine for health function.
- mechanism
    + Vitamin B1 is a coenzyme to the TCA cycle and the pentose phosphate shunt. Thiamine first metabolised into thiaimine dipshopahte. 
    + body has 2-3 weeks of thiamine reserves in the liver before it is excreted from the liver
    + thought that alcohol decreases conversion of thiamine into the active coenzyme, and severe alcoholism is as associated with decreased intake. 
    + decreased storage of thiamine in the liver @alcoholic fatty liver disease
    + decreased active absorption @GIT - specifically at the duodenum, passive absorption is maintained
- clinical
    + risk factors
        * heavy alcohol consumption
        * malnutrition
        * celiacs disease may have lower threshold for WE @duodenal destruction which is where b1 absorption predominantly occurs
    + presentation 
        * triad
            - encephalopathy
                + profound disoritentation/ apathy/ inattention. impaired cognition, memory
            - opthalmoplegia (variable findings)
                + ++%nystagmus esp manifests @horizontal gaze, 
                + %opthalgmoplegia: lateral rectus palsy, conjugate gaze palsies (@lesions to CN3/6/8 nuclei). usu a combination of abn
            - gait ataxia
                + wide base gait, slow short spaced steps. likely @vestibular/ cerebellar dysfunction
        * %also associated with featurees of alcohol withdrawal
            - aggression/ agitation
        * %associated with:
            - peripheral neuropathy with paraesthesia and weakness
            - %%hypothermia


# Korsakoff psychosis (Korsakoff syndrome)
- basics
    + advanced and permanent form of WE/ usu preceded by episodes of WE. @thiamine def @usu alcohol abuse. resulting in severe irreversible debilitation.
    + aterograde/ retrograde amnesia
- medical   
    + etiology
        * ++@alchol abuse/ malnutrition
        * hyperemesis gravidarum
        * Hg poisoning
        * bil thalamic infarctions
    + prognosis
        * poor @rarely recover. require social support. 
- clinical
    + presentation
        * usu accompanied with features of WE, but sometimes the WE episode is subclinical.
        * severe anterograde/ retrograde amnesia
            - long term memory may be preserved. 
        * apathy and other behavioural changes (eg agitation/ irritability)
        * preservation of episodic memory and other cognitive features
        * %confabulation
        * anosagnosia
        * amensia of fixation
        * neuromuscular dysfunction
        * minimal content in conversation
- investigate
    + radio
        * MRI: atrophy of the mamillary bodies indicates previous WE. %corpus callosum and medial thalami atrophy.
        * PET: -=glucose metabolism in frontal/ parietal/ cingulate gyrus
- treatment
    + cognitive therapies
    + vitb1 supplementation

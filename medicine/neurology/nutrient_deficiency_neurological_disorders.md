    + common acute neurological encephalopathy @thiamine (vitB1) deficiency
    + classic triad of oculomotor dysfx, gait ataxia, encephalopathic sx
    + late stage == korsakoff syndrome (id @presence of aterograde/ retrograde amnesia). %WE episode may be subclinical and KS may develop. KS can have permanent implications for cognition

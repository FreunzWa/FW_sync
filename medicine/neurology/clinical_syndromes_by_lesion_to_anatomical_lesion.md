###### Clinical syndromes by lesion to anatomical lesion

# Non-dominant parietal lobe signs
- involved in higher processing of cortical sensations
- clinical syndrome (the following %present @lesion):
    + agraphaesthesia (ability to reconigse)
    + tactile extinction (inability to determine side of stimulus when both sides are stimulated at the same time)
    + sensory/ visual inattention 
    + visual field testing
    + astereogenesis (tactile agnosia - ability to recognise object when eyes closed. manifests opposite side)
    + two point discrinimation 
    + dressing (get patient to get dressed, take off and put back on)/ constructional aphasia (copy drawn object) 
    + spatial neglect

# Temporal lobe function
- short term memory
- episodic memory tests (what year WW2 ended)

# Frontal lobe function
- test primitive reflexes/ pout reflexes

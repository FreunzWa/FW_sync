###### Neuroanatomy


# Ventricular system
- lateral ventricles
    + interventricular foramen (foramen of Monro)
        * drains lateral ventricles into 3rd ventricle
- 3rd ventricle
    + cerebral aqueduct (of Sylvius)
        * drains 3rd ventricle into 4th ventricle
- 4th ventricle
    + lateral apertures (of Luschka)
        * 2x one on either side, link 4th ventricle ot the cerebellopontine/ pontine cistern (SA space)
    + median aperture (of Magendie)
        * drains CSF from the 4th ve

# Subarachnoid cisternae
- spaces formed @openings in the SA space as subarachnoid only covers superficial surface unlike the pia. 
    + Cisterna magna (cerebellomedullaris cistern)
        * in angle btwn dorsal medulla and ventral cerebellum
    + cerebellopontine cistern/ pontine cistern
        * ventral aspect of the pons, drains the 4th ventricle through the foramen of lushcka (the lateral apertures)
        * contains basilar artery, AICA, origin of the superior cerebellar arteries, CN6
    + interpeduncular cistern
        * between cerebral peduncles of the midbraina nd the dorsum sellae and continous below with the pontine cistern. 
        * contains optic chiasm, basilar artery bifurcation, PCA, Superior cerebellar arteries, PCOMs, CN3
    + lumbar cistern
        * extends from conus medullaris ==> level of S2 vertebra. contains cauda equina and filum terminale. (site of LP)

# Tectum / Quadrigeminal plate
- Aka tectal plate, portion of dorsal midbrain upon which the superior and inferior colliculi sit.
- derived @alar plate of the neural tube
- related pathology
    + @masses in this region == parinaud syndrome or obstructive hydrocephalus

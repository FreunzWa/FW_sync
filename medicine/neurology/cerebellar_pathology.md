###### Cerebellum

# Anatomy
- basics
    + psoterior to pons, inferior to cerebrum and tentorium (an infolding of dura mater), a part of the metencephalon (which also includes the pons)
    + divided into 3 stuctures: two hemispheres (containing the dentate nuclei) separated by a midline component 'the vermis' (containing the emoliform and globus, fastigial nuclei)
    + divided by larger folds into 10 discrete lobules
    + grey matter cortex surrounding interior white matter 'arbor vitae'
    + 4 deep cerebellar nuclei

- Surface anatomy
    + Anterior lobe
        * separated from posterior by the V-shaped primary fissure.
    + Posterior lobe
    + Flocculonodular lobe (aka the vestibulocerebellum)
        * situated anteroinferiorly
        * Consists of nodulus centrally which connects the flocculi
        * connections to vestibular nuclei, esp about head movement to influence eye movement, muscle tone/ equilibrium
        * oldest part phylogenetically.
- Grey matter anatomy
    + deep cerebellar nuclei (4 deep nuclei @center of white matter). 
        * they are the sole output channel (apart from flocculonodular direct connection to CN8 nucleus) for the cerebellum
        * from lateral to medial:
            - denate
                + in the lateral hemispheres
            - interposed (globose and emboliform)
                + in the paravermal/ intermediate zone
            - fastigial
                + in the vermis
    + cortex
        * molecular layer, purkinje cell layer, granule cell layer, fibres
- White matter anatomy
    + Arbor vitae
    + Peduncles
- Functional
    + midline cerebellar structures required for motor execution, rapid and slow eye movement6s, balance, vestibular function
    + hemispherical structures involved @motor planning and coordination of complex tasks. 
- Vascular anatomy
    + 3 arteries supply the cerebellum, each emanating from the basilar artery
    + SCA bilaterally branch off basilar just inf to bifurc into PCA. supplies blood to pons on way == supplies blood to cerebellar cortex.
    + AICA branches bilaterally off lateral basilar just superior to VAs == branches along inferior pons == supplies the middle cerebellar penduncle, CN7,8. 
    + PICA branches off lateral VAs inferior to BA == PICA sends branches to medulla == supplies CN nuclei == supplies blood to posterior inferior portion of cerebellum



# Cerebellar lesions
- basics
    + divided @sx arising from damage to midline structures or hemispheric structures, but ++overlap. 
- medical
    + midline cerebellar structure leions:
        * gait ataxia, imbalance (postive Romberg's sign), truncal ataxia, dysmetria (usu lower extremity proprioception/ coordination), ocular findings (saccadic intrusions), head bobbing, vertigo
    + hemispherical lesions:
        * ipsilateral manifestations of dysdiadochokinesis (defect @rapid alternating movements), dysmetria (esp upper limbs), limb ataxia, intention tremor (when hand moves closer to target), scanning speech (oral motor ataxia ^dysarthria).

###### Migraines

# Basics

- epidemiology
    + 12%. F-17%. M-6%
    + migraine without aura most common (75%), however most have prodrome sx
    
# Medical
- mx
    + complex neuronal/ vasculare mechanism involving trigeminal nerve afferents == sensation of headache.
    + Cortical spreading depression (of Leao), propagating wave of depolarisation that spreads across cortex (==aura/ affects trigeminal nerve/ alterred BBB permeability)
        * trigeminal nerve afferents nociception upregulated @cortical spreading depression. 
    + vascular mx likely rather epiphenomenon (with the neurological prodrome/ postdrome features)


# Clinical
- rf
    + family hx significant
- presentation 
    + phases
        * 77%premonitory symptoms
            - 24-48 hrs prior to headache. affective/ vegetative sx w/ yawning, depression, neck stiffness, constipation. 
        * 25%aura (completely reversible focal neurological sx). <1 hr. usu develops over 5 minutes.
            -  positive: visual (scintillating scotoma), auditory (tinnitus, noises, musci), sensory (paraesthesia), motor (jerking, tremor). 
            - negative: loss of vision/ hearing/ feeling/ paralysis of limb
        * headache
        * postdrome

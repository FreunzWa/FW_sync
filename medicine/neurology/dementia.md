###### Dementia

# Classification
    Alzheimer's disease (60-80% of all dementias)
    Vascular dementia
    Dementia with lewy bodies (Parkinson's dementia)
    Fronto-temporal dementia

    Less common
        Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
        Pick's disease
        Huntington's disease
        Inherited metabolic disorders
        Normal pressure hydrocephalus

# Vascular dementia
- basics
    + 2nd most common form of dementia, @chronic vascular disease affecting brain == progressive white matter ischaemia
- clinical
    + rf
        * vascular disease/ atherosclerosis/ CVD/ DM/ HTN
- investigate
    + radio
        * leukoaraiosis (diffuse white matter changes @small vessel disease). often incidental (++have them @age), but @accumulation == VaD.
        * MRI more SN, for microhemorrhages/ cerebral amyloid angiopathy/ chronic hypertensive encephalopathy


# Alzheimer's disease
- basics
- class
    + classical (typical)/ atypicl (variant) AD
- medical
    + mx: @amyloid beta accumulation == cortical atrophy esp hippocampus == -=formation of episodic memories.
    + Nutrition: @loss of smell/ cognitive decline/ inability to cook == -=caloric intake 
    + %associated with primary progressive apahssai (the lopogenic form of primary progressive aphasia)
- clinical
    + rf
        * female, age, APOE4 carrier, smoker, Fhx
    + severity @former cognitive reserve in premorbid fx
- investigate
    + diagnose @clinical syndrome +/- histological confirmation (rarely done). neuroimaging to increase confidence in diagnosis.
    + CSF (may aid in diagnosis) 
        * beta-amyloid, total tau, hyperphosphorylated tau
    + radio
        * MRI: assess volume change in characteristic locations, much more SN @mid-late disease. mesial temporal lobe atrophy (hippocampus + entorhinal cortex) and temporoparietal cortical atrophy
        * FDG-PET shows hypoactive in affected regions
- treat
    + pharma
        * cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), %improve memory in the early stages, but does not change progression 
        * NMDA antagonists (eg memantine) @block pathological over-stimulation of NMDA receptors 
        * antioxidants - Vitamin E, selegiline (MOAi)
        * medications for behavioural sx: antidepressants, anxiolytics, antiparkinsonism, sedatives(anticonvulsants)
    + Nutrition: eval nutrition, use supplements. decrease alcohol @often over-drink @memory loss. 
    + rehabilitation
        * exercise programs, occupational therapy 
--------------------------------------------------

# Behavioural variant Frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD)
- basics
    + FTD is a group of clinically heterogenous neurodegen disorders w/ changes in psychosocial behaviour/ aphasia. %also develop concomitant motor syndrome (PD/  MND)
    + more common cause of early onset dementia. avg PC @50s
    + FTD covers 3 main distinct clinical presentation (2 of the 3 types of PPA are @FTD)
        * behavioural variant FTD
        * semantic progressive aphasia
        * nonfluent progressive aphasia (aka agrammatic PPA)
- diagnosis
    + biopsy   
        * seldom done, %find 'pick' bodies, earlier thought to be cause of all FTD, but not so.
- clinical syndromes
    + bvFTD (most common ~50% of FTD)
        * disinhibition (socially innapropriate behaviour)
        * apathy/ loss of empathy (loss of motivation to maintain social relationships)
        * binge eating (esp sweet foods), ++consumption of alcohol, excessive amounts of food, may attempt to eat inedible objects
        * compulsive behaviours, hoarding, checking, cleaning, religious hobbies, rigid food preferences
        * usu lack CN, snensory, cerebellar, pyramidal involvement. 15-20% develop MND, CBS or PSP
- investigate
    + bvFTD neuroimaging 50%shows focal frontal/ temporal atrophy in early stages. %insula/ amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex. 
    + %ventricular dilation @atrophy
    + there are neuroanatomic correlations:
        * medical frontal/ anterior cingulate == apathy
        * right anterior temporal/ right medial frontal == loss of empathy
        * right insula/ striatum/ orbitofrontal == changes in eating behaviour
        * orbitofrontal/ caudate/ temporal lobe == ritualistic compulsions
- diagnosis
    + made clinically (6 different personality changes, if 3+ present FTD diagnosis made). or probable diagnosis @imaging findings + some features of bvFTD

# Primary progressive aphasia
- basics
    + gradual development of aphasia w/ various defecits in language. PPA arises @subtype of FTD /AD when the language dominant hemisphere is the principle target. 
    + early stages == isolated language defecits other cognitive domains are preserved, late stage == other
    + 3 subtypes
        * nonfluent PPA (FTD)
        * semantic variant PPA (FTD)
        * lopogenic PPA (AD)
- medical
    + cx/ progression
        * may progress to affect other cognitive domains, or develop into MND
- clinical
    + all 3 domains
        * word finding
    + non-fluent PPA
        * motor speech defecit, articulatory difficulty of actually pronouncing words, very effortful. (patient has problems pronouncing eg. caterpillar)
    + semantic variant PPA
        * impaired single word comprehensions and object naming (esp for low frequency items) in the early stages, progresses to complete comprehension defecit.
        * loss of semantic knowledge about objects, eg when drawing turtle forget the shell.
        * begins with asymmetric temporal lobe involvement, @late stage becomes bilateral and affects behavioural domains and episodic memory
    + lopogenic PPA
        * impaired single word retrieval/ repetition with errors in speech/ naming.
        * spared object knowledge/ single word comprehension
        * like non fluent usu has slow pace of speech, but not @articulation difficulties @apraxia like in non fluent, but rather difficulties @word finding.
- investigate
    + radio
        * structural/ functional imaging show hypoperfusion /atrophy of frontal /temporal lobes in pattern specific to each variant

###### Dementia

# Classification
    Alzheimer's disease (60-80% of all dementias)
    Vascular dementia
    Dementia with lewy bodies (Parkinson's dementia)
    Fronto-temporal dementia

    Less common
        Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
        Pick's disease
        Huntington's disease
        Inherited metabolic disorders

# Vascular dementia
- basics
    + 2nd most common form of dementia, @chronic vascular disease affecting brain == progressive white matter ischaemia
- clinical
    + rf
        * vascular disease/ atherosclerosis/ CVD/ DM/ HTN
- investigate
    + radio
        * leukoaraiosis (diffuse white matter changes @small vessel disease). often incidental (++have them @age), but @accumulation == VaD.
        * MRI more SN, for microhemorrhages/ cerebral amyloid angiopathy/ chronic hypertensive encephalopathy


# Alzheimer's disease
- basics
- class
    + classical (typical)/ atypicl (variant) AD
- medical
    + mx: @amyloid beta accumulation == cortical atrophy esp hippocampus == -=formation of episodic memories.
    + Nutrition: @loss of smell/ cognitive decline/ inability to cook == -=caloric intake 
- clinical
    + rf
        * female, age, APOE4 carrier, smoker, Fhx
    + severity @former cognitive reserve in premorbid fx
- investigate
    + diagnose @clinical syndrome +/- histological confirmation (rarely done). neuroimaging to increase confidence in diagnosis.
    + CSF (may aid in diagnosis) 
        * beta-amyloid, total tau, hyperphosphorylated tau
    + radio
        * MRI: assess volume change in characteristic locations, much more SN @mid-late disease. mesial temporal lobe atrophy (hippocampus + entorhinal cortex) and temporoparietal cortical atrophy
        * FDG-PET shows hypoactive in affected regions
- treat
    + pharma
        * cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), %improve memory in the early stages, but does not change progression 
        * NMDA antagonists (eg memantine) @block pathological over-stimulation of NMDA receptors 
        * antioxidants - Vitamin E, selegiline (MOAi)
        * medications for behavioural sx: antidepressants, anxiolytics, antiparkinsonism, sedatives(anticonvulsants)
    + Nutrition: eval nutrition, use supplements. decrease alcohol @often over-drink @memory loss. 
    + rehabilitation
        * exercise programs, occupational therapy 
        *

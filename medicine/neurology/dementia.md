# Vascular dementia
- basics
    + 2nd most common form of dementia, @chronic vascular disease affecting brain == progressive white matter ischaemia. +/- history of stroke
    + a form of vascular cognitive impairment
    + may be @post-stroke dementia or long term vascular ischaemia
- medical
    + etiology
        * ateriolosclerosis (most common) @hypertensoin == chronic narrowing/ stenosis of vessels @%charcot bouchard == small haemorrhages == chronic WMAI
        * CAA - deposition of amyloid in small vessels in leptomeninges and cerebral cortex
        * genetic condition swhich cause cerebrovascular disease
- clinical
    + rf
        * vascular disease/ atherosclerosis/ CVD/ DM/ HTN/ metabolic syndrome, smoking, CAD, AF, dyslipidaemia, low SE status, low cognitive reserve
    + presentation
        * Post-stroke dementia: stepwise cognitive decline following stroke, impairemnt of executive functions/ sparing of eepisodic memory.
- investigate
    + radio
        * leukoaraiosis (diffuse white matter changes @small vessel disease). often incidental (++have them @age), but @accumulation == VaD.
        * MRI more SN, for microhemorrhages/ cerebral amyloid angiopathy/ chronic hypertensive encephalopathy

# Alzheimer's disease
- basics
- class
    + classical (typical)/ atypicl (variant) AD
- medical
    + mx: @amyloid beta accumulation == cortical atrophy esp hippocampus == -=formation of episodic memories.
    + Nutrition: @loss of smell/ cognitive decline/ inability to cook == -=caloric intake 
    + %associated with primary progressive apahssai (the lopogenic form of primary progressive aphasia)
- clinical
    + rf
        * female, age, APOE4 carrier, smoker, Fhx
    + severity @former cognitive reserve in premorbid fx
- investigate
    + diagnose @clinical syndrome +/- histological confirmation (rarely done). neuroimaging to increase confidence in diagnosis. 
    + CSF (may aid in diagnosis) 
        * beta-amyloid, total tau, hyperphosphorylated tau
    + radio
        * MRI: assess volume change in characteristic locations, much more SN @mid-late disease. mesial temporal lobe atrophy (hippocampus + entorhinal cortex) and temporoparietal cortical atrophy
        * FDG-PET shows hypoactive in affected regions
- treat
    + pharma
        * cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), %improve memory in the early stages, but does not change progression, only provides moderate symptomatic relief in some with AD
        * NMDA antagonists (eg memantine) @block pathological over-stimulation of NMDA receptors 
        * antioxidants - Vitamin E, selegiline (MOAi)
        * medications for behavioural sx: antidepressants, anxiolytics, antiparkinsonism, sedatives(anticonvulsants)
    + Nutrition: eval nutrition, use supplements. decrease alcohol @often over-drink @memory loss. 
    + rehabilitation
        * exercise programs, occupational therapy

# Behavioural variant Frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) - Pick's disease
- basics
    + FTD is a group of clinically heterogenous neurodegen disorders w/ changes in psychosocial behaviour/ aphasia. %also develop concomitant motor syndrome (PD/  MND)
    + more common cause of early onset dementia. avg PC @50s. 
    + terminal illness. prognosis related to rapidity of decline
    + FTD covers 3 main distinct clinical presentation (2 of the 3 types of PPA are @FTD)
        * behavioural variant FTD
        * semantic progressive aphasia
        * nonfluent progressive aphasia (aka agrammatic PPA)
- diagnosis
    + biopsy   
        * seldom done, %find 'pick' bodies, earlier thought to be cause of all FTD, but not so.
- clinical syndromes
    + bvFTD (most common ~50% of FTD)
        * disinhibition (socially innapropriate behaviour)
        * apathy/ loss of empathy (loss of motivation to maintain social relationships)
        * binge eating (esp sweet foods), ++consumption of alcohol, excessive amounts of food, may attempt to eat inedible objects
        * compulsive behaviours, hoarding, checking, cleaning, religious hobbies, rigid food preferences
        * usu lack CN, snensory, cerebellar, pyramidal involvement. 15-20% develop MND, CBS or PSP
- investigate
    + bvFTD neuroimaging 50%shows focal frontal/ temporal atrophy in early stages. %insula/ amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex. 
    + %ventricular dilation @atrophy
    + there are neuroanatomic correlations:
        * medical frontal/ anterior cingulate == apathy
        * right anterior temporal/ right medial frontal == loss of empathy
        * right insula/ striatum/ orbitofrontal == changes in eating behaviour
        * orbitofrontal/ caudate/ temporal lobe == ritualistic compulsions
- diagnosis
    + made clinically (6 different personality changes, if 3+ present FTD diagnosis made). or probable diagnosis @imaging findings + some features of bvFTD

# Primary progressive aphasia (PPA)
- basics
    + gradual development of aphasia w/ various defecits in language. PPA arises @subtype of FTD /AD when the language dominant hemisphere is the principle target. 
    + unlike stroke aphasias it gradually gets worse and worse, and consists of a spectrum of different manifestations of aphasia.
    + early stages == isolated language defecits other cognitive domains are preserved, late stage == other
    + 3 subtypes
        * nonfluent PPA (FTD)
        * semantic variant PPA (FTD)
        * lopogenic PPA (AD)
- medical
    + cx/ progression
        * may progress to affect other cognitive domains, or develop into MND
- treatment
    + allied health
        * restorative therapy
        * compensatory therapy
            - augmentative communication apps
            - words to speech help @some cases
            - whiteboard to draw word when cannot remember
        * social therapy
- clinical
    + all 3 domains
        * word finding
    + non-fluent PPA
        * motor speech defecit, articulatory difficulty of actually pronouncing words, very effortful. (patient has problems pronouncing eg. caterpillar). 
    + semantic variant PPA
        * impaired single word comprehensions and object naming (esp for low frequency items) in the early stages, progresses to complete comprehension defecit.
        * loss of semantic knowledge about objects, eg when drawing turtle forget the shell.
        * begins with asymmetric temporal lobe involvement, @late stage becomes bilateral and affects behavioural domains and episodic memory
    + lopogenic PPA
        * impaired single word retrieval/ repetition with errors in speech/ naming.
        * spared object knowledge/ single word comprehension
        * like non fluent usu has slow pace of speech, but not @articulation difficulties @apraxia like in non fluent, but rather difficulties @word finding (every day words like 'table'). reading may be impaired. understand the meanings of the words but cannot say the word. may choose incorrect words. may lose comprehension when people speak quickly.
- investigate
    + radio
        * structural/ functional imaging show hypoperfusion /atrophy of frontal /temporal lobes in pattern specific to each variant
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS)
- basics
    + rare AD heritable human prion disease w/ complete penetrance. progressive degeneration of the cerebellum w/ varying degrees of dementia in midlife (40s) 
- clinical
    + presentation
        * cerebellar degeneration == gait apraxia, discoordination, dysesthesia, hyporeflexia, proximal weakness of the legs
- investigate
    + CSF/ imaging is normal in GSS, however EEG may show slowing, but not as SN as is in CJD
    + Genetic studies: most SP way @PRNP mutations @++cases are familial.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

# Dementia with Lewy Bodies
- basics
    + pathological hallmark of eosinophilic intracellular inclusions called Lew Bodies (of alpha synuclein) in deep cortical layers throughout the brain
    + important to correctly diagnose LBD @treatment options are specific to DLB as ooposed to other typeds of demdentia.
    + distinguish from Parkinsons disease dementia, which is when dementia occurs in setting of well establisheed parkinsonism, while DLB dementia signs usu precede onset of parkinsonism or develop coincidentally.
- diagnosis
    + diagnosis requires:
        * dementia (esp following domains)
            - attention
            - executive function
            - visuospatial function
        * two other core clinical features of DLB (usu appear early and persist). one core clincial feature and 1 supporting feature is suggestive of probable DLB
            - cognitive fluctuations (in 60-80%)
                + episodic, a differential is stroke/ seizure. people blank out with staring episodes/ become confused or behave bizzarely, %with motor features, %excessively somnolent
            - vivid visual hallucinations (in 2/3)
                + most useful clinical feature to distinguish from AD (in which hallucatinsion are uncommon)
                + eg people/ animals, abstract colors/ shapes. characteristically very vivid hallucinations
            - rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder\
                + sleep related vocalisation or motor behaviours during REM that coirrelates with dream mentation. usu short in duration. %sleep related injuries. 
            - parkinsonism (70-90%)
                + usu sx are milder, but %as severe as idiopathic PD
                + esp brady/ akinesia/ limb rigidity + gait disorder. 
                + %%tremor, and more mild.
        * supporting features
            - very poor tolerance of antipsychotics (NMS, irreversible parkinsonism)
            - low Dopamine transporter uptake in PET/ SPECT
            - repeated falls
            - hypersomnia
            - autononomic dysfx
            - halluciations in other modalities
            - delusiosn
            - anxiety/ depression
- clinical
    + presentation
        * dementia (progressive cognitive decline, of sufficient magnitude to interfere with normal social and occupational function), eg impairments to exec function, attention, visuoperceptual ability.
            - usu presents first with loss to attention and executive/ visuospatial function rather than memory loss. (care must be taken to distinguish attention defecit from memory loss)
            - early signs: -=job performance, failing to see stop signs or other cars eetc.
        * autonomic dysfunction (orthosattic hypotention, urinary incontinence or retention, constipation and other GI sx). >%@PD, but <%@MSA
        * hypersomnia (daytime somnolence)
- investigation
    + cognitive testing
        * MMSE/ RUDAS/ MOCA tests that may be affected
            - clock drwawing (visuospatial and attention)
            - WORLD backwards (attention)
            - serial sevens (attention)
            - overlapping pentagonss (visuospatial)
    + imaging
        * MRI shows diffuse cortical thinning, with sparing of hippocampus relative to AD.
- rx
    + by feature
        * dementia
            - cholinesterase inhibitors, limited evidence. (rivastigmine, donepezil, galantamine, memantine)
        * sleep behaviour disorder
            - most patient respond to melatonin or clonazepam
            - set up bedtime environment to be as safe as possible
        * treat urinary incontinence/ retendtion.
        * psychoses
            - antipsychotics
        * parkinsonism
            - treatemnt with levodopa, but generally less successful than idiopathic PD

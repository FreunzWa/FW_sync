###### Vascular Neurology

# Cerebral cavernous venous malformations (CAVMs/ cavernous malformation)
- Basics
    + cavernoma/ cavernous hemangioma are previous terms, not used as much @these are not neoplastic lesions
    + usu single lesions, @multiple lesions suggest syndrome
- pathophysiology
    + common cerebral vascular malformation w/ thrombosed vessels and surrounding hemosiderin deposition. 
    + unlike AVMs, no normal brain in interstices of the lesions.
- clinical
    + presentation
        * usu sx @start 40-60 yrs, but ++%asymptomatic throughout life
        * mass effect/ focal neuro sx/ seizures @temporal location etc


# Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (CAVMs)
- basics
    + intracranial cerebral vascular malformation of nidus of vessels between feeding artery and vein  
    + 4% of population, symptomatic in 12% in teh affected population
    + congenital/ dysregulation of VEGF
- classification
    + grading
        * 1: size, 2: deep, 3: proximity to important structures.
- pathophysiology
    + feeding arteries dilated @++pressure == aneurysm formation, also ++venous aneurysm (pouches). 
    + %calcification/ gliotic tissue
    + ++@supratentorial,66% superficial
    + 2% multiple AVMs
- clinical
    + presentation
        * mass effect/ focal neurological sx/ raised ICP sx
        * 20%seizures, %ischaemic events sx @vascular steal
- investigate
    + radio
        * vasuclar nidus hyperdense @CT.
        * no mass effect until bleeding occurred
        * CTA == classic bag of worms appearance (total vacular territory becomes obvious)
        * T2 shows flow voids
        * %see previous hemorrhage/ surrounding vasogenic edema

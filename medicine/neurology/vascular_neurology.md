###### Vascular Neurology

# Cerebral cavernous venous malformations (CAVMs/ cavernous malformation)
- Basics
    + ?: cavernoma common, found throughout body.
- investigate  

# Vertebrobasilar aneurysm
- basics
    + vertebrobasilar aneurysm are 10% of brain aneurysms. usu present w/ CN/ brainstem sx @pressure effects. RR hemorrhage < berry aneurysm




# Cerebrovascular accidents 
    ischaemic stroke
    hemorrhagic stroke
        @AVM
        @aneurysmal (eg SAH)

# Fischer scale
- risk of vasospasm as predicted by imaging findings (diffusivity of blood/ thickness of blood on MRI /CTB)

# Hunter and hess scoring system
- based on clinical features assoc with SAH, predictor of survival
- Grade 1: asymptomat/ minimal headache ^slight neck stiffness (70% survival)
- Grade 2: moderate-severe headache, neck stiffness (60% survival)
- Grade 3: drowsy, minimal neurological defecit (50%)
- Grdae 4: stuporous, severe hemiparesis, %decerebrate rigidty (20%)
- Grade 5: comatose, decerebrate rigidty, moribund (10%)

# Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
- basics
    + @berry aneurysmal rupture ++@COW bifurcations (PCOM/ ACOM/ MCA bifurcations)
- medical
    + sources of hemorrhage
        * 85%ruptured berry 
        * 10%perimesencephalic hemorrhage (non aneurysmal cause or vertebrobasilar aneurysm)

        * smoking, hypertension, family history, alcohol
        * Japanese/ African/ finnish
    + presentation
        * 'thunderclap' headache, worst ever experienced. 50%instant, but may come on over minutes.
        * %seizures/ neck stiffness (usu only after hours @inflam reaction to big hemorrhage in SA space)
    + history
        * 40%sentinel headache preceding SAH by up to 20 days
        * often triggered @exercise/ strenous activity/ cocaine etc abuse
    + exam 
        * ocular
            - %retinal hemorrhages
            - %%vitreous (pre-retinal) hemorrhage [aka Terson syndrome] == ++mortality @means ++rapid increase ICP.
    + investigate
        * protocol
            - CT ==> LP 12 hours after onset of headache @negative CT 
            - ==> %MRI @CT -ve/ LP +ve

            - CT: ++SN/SP esp <12 hours, @delay, SN ++falls. @small SAH == %occult. hyperattenuating material @SA space arnd COW or in Sylvian's. (see modified Fisher's scale for grading, predicts vasospasm)
        * LP (better @late presentation @development of xantho). @negative CTB but high clinical suspicion
            - opening pressures will be elevated
            - red cell count (if no drop between 1st-3rd bottles == SAH diagnosed) but FN @bloody tap.
            - culture (pneumococcal meningitis %p/w thunderclap)
        * xanthochromia
            - 96% SN @ >12 hours after rupture/ headache.  %FP @truamatic tap w/ false xanthochromia @oxyhaemoglobin and delay before analysis.
            - spectrophotometry SN > visual inspection

# Perimesencephalic non aneurysmal SAH PM-NASAH
- basics
    + 10% the cause of SAH, blood collects in basal cisternae, anterior to pons/ midbrain. %involve proximal sylvian's
    +  @venous bleed (non-aneurysmal) 
-  medical
    +  thought to be @either venous origin/ perforating vessel rupture, basilar artery wall haematoma. thoguht to be a low pressur ebleed due to low degree of haemorrhage
- investigate
    + risk scoring:
        * usu low Hunter and Hess scores
     + radio
        * CTA to rule out aneurysm of the vertebrobasilar system or COW. @non-aneurysmal == better prognosis
        * often the cause of the bleed in PMNASAH is not elucidated even after imaging
- presentation
    + similar to SAH, but usu less severe
    + sudden onset headache non-similar to previous events that is maximal pain at onset (SUM)
    + %assoc N/V, meningismus, photophoiba
    + no sentinel headache

# Perimesencephalic aneurysmal SAH (vertebrobasilar aneurysm) PM-SAH
- basics
    + vertebrobasilar aneurysm (==worse prognosis), usu arising @posterior circulation (vertebrobasilar junction, SCA, PICA, PCA

# Pituitary apoplexy

    + @hemorrhagic necrosis of the pituitary == med emergency. %non hemorrhagic etiology causing necrosis.
    + ++underlying macroadenoma (~80%), or other pituitary abn
- medical
    + cx
        * @pituitary dysfunction == endocrine derangements == %Addisonian crisis/ pan-hypopituitarism (endocrine emergency)
- clinical
    + rf = rf for pituitary macroadenoma + HTN/ bleeding rf
        * treatment for prolactinoma (esp bromocriptine)
        * prior irradiation of macroadenoma

# Cerebral cavernous vascular malformations (CCVMs)
    + cavernoma/ cavernous hemangioma are previous terms, not used as much @these are not neoplastic lesions
    + usu single lesions, @multiple lesions suggest syndrome
- pathophysiology
    + common cerebral vascular malformation w/ thrombosed vessels and surrounding hemosiderin deposition. 
    + unlike AVMs, no normal brain in interstices of the lesions.
    + ++supratentorial
- clinical
    + rf
        * RT, familial/ syndromes
    + presentation
        * usu sx @start 40-60 yrs, but ++%asymptomatic throughout life
        * mass effect/ focal neuro sx/ seizures @temporal location etc
- investigate
    + radio
        * no enhancement on CT, but @large == region of hyperdensity %seen, %see evidence of recent hemorrhage/ edema
        * MRI better, see "popcorn/ berry" w/ rim signal loss @hemosiderin deposition (SWI great for detecting)
        * DSA: CVMs are angiographically occult, w/ no arteriovenous shunting


# Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (CAVMs)
- basics
    + intracranial cerebral vascular malformation of nidus of vessels between feeding artery and vein  
    + 4% of population, symptomatic in 12% in teh affected population
    + congenital/ dysregulation of VEGF
    + 90%supratentorial
    + account for 10%SAH, 1-2% of all storkes
- medical
    + mechanism
        * @nidus exposed to ++high pressure arterial flow rate == ++development of aneurysm/ rupture
    + etiology
        * congenital, may be associated with conditions (hereditary hemorrhagic telnagiectasia, osler-weber-rendu syndrome).
    + %assoc with spinal/ brainstem AVMs esp @HHT (multiple AVMs ++suggestive of HHT)
- diagnosis
    + CT/ MRi visualisation, followed by angiography to guide therapy.
- classification
    + grading
        * 1: size, 2: deep, 3: proximity to important structures.
- pathophysiology
    + feeding arteries dilated @++pressure == aneurysm formation, also ++venous aneurysm (pouches). 
    + %calcification/ gliotic tissue
    + ++@supratentorial,66% superficial
    + 2% multiple AVMs
- treat
    + surgery: determine suitable/ safe @Spetzler-Martin grading system. 
    + radio-intervention: esp done @lesions risk for surgical therapy based on location or @++risk of bleeding.
    + stereotactic radiosurgery is increasingly explored as an option
- clinical
    + presentation
        * mass effect/ focal neurological sx/ raised ICP sx, headache
        * 20%seizures (usu focal), %ischaemic events sx @vascular steal
        * intracranial hemorrhage sx
- investigate
    + radio (impression: flow voids esily visualised @T2)
        * vascular nidus hyperdense @CT.
        * no mass effect until bleeding occurred
        * CTA == classic bag of worms appearance (total vacular territory becomes obvious)
        * T2 shows flow voids (thus the AVM looks hypointense @surrounding parenchyma, like a bunch of black worms)
        * %see previous hemorrhage/ surrounding vasogenic edema

# Posterior circulation CVA syndromes
- basics
    + 20%ischaemic events involve posterior circulation (vertebrobasilar structures)
- related neurological syndromes
    + Gerstmann syndrome (left PCA stroke - dominant hemisphere)
        * (RAAF) right-left disorientation, agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia.
            - get patient to point to R/L limbs, then your limbs
            - get patient to write name
            - get patient to do simple maths, serial 7s is the best test to use, standardized.
            - get patient to say what finger pointing to (index, ring, middle, etc.), do it with pt eyes closed, tap finger and get pt to say
        * inferior parietal lobule of the dominant hemisphere, which is in the left PCA territory.
    + Right PCA stroke (or non dominant hemishere)
        * (DISC face)
            - dressing apraxia
            - insighting lacking into illness (anosagnosia)
            - spatial neglect
            - constructional apraxia (cannot copy pictures)
            - prosopagnosia

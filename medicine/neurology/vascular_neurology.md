###### Vascular Neurology

# Cerebral cavernous venous malformations (CAVMs/ cavernous malformation)
- Basics
    + ?: cavernoma common, found throughout body.
- investigate  

# Vertebrobasilar aneurysm
- basics
    + vertebrobasilar aneurysm are 10% of brain aneurysms. usu present w/ CN/ brainstem sx @pressure effects. RR hemorrhage < berry aneurysm




# Cerebrovascular accidents 
    ischaemic stroke
    hemorrhagic stroke
        @AVM
        @aneurysmal (eg SAH)


# Subarachnoid hemorrhage
- basics

        * smoking, hypertension, family history, alcohol
        * Japanese/ African/ finnish
    + presentation
        * 'thunderclap' headache, worst ever experienced. 50%instant, but may come on over minutes.
        * %seizures/ neck stiffness (usu only after hours @inflam reaction to big hemorrhage in SA space)
    + history
        * 30-50%sentinel headache preceding SAH by up to 20 days
    + exam 
        * ocular
            - %retinal hemorrhages
            - %%vitreous (pre-retinal) hemorrhage [aka Terson syndrome] == ++mortality @means ++rapid increase ICP.
    + investigate
        * protocol
            - CT ==> LP 12 hours after onset of headache @negative CT 
            - ==> %MRI @CT -ve/ LP +ve
        * radio
            - CT: ++SN/SP esp <12 hours, @delay, SN ++falls. @small SAH == %occult. hyperattenuating material @SA space arnd COW or in Sylvian's. (see modified Fisher's scale for grading, predicts vasospasm)
        * LP (better @late presentation @development of xantho)
            - opening pressures
            - red cell count (if no drop between 1st-3rd bottles == SAH diagnosed) but FN @bloody tap.
            - culture (pneumococcal meningitis %p/w thunderclap)
        * xanthochromia
            - 96% SN @ >12 hours after rupture/ headache.  %FP @truamatic tap w/ false xanthochromia @oxyhaemoglobin and delay before analysis.
            - spectrophotometry SN > visual inspection
            
# Perimesencephalic hemorrhage
- basics
    + 10% the cause of SAH, blood collects in basal cisternae, anterior to pons/ midbrain. %involve proximal sylvian's
    + either @venous bleed (non-aneurysmal) or vertebrobasilar aneurysm (==worse prognosis)
- investigate
    + radio
        * CTA to search for aneurysm. @non-aneurysmal == better prognosis

# Pituitary apoplexy
- basics
    + @hemorrhagic necrosis of the pituitary == med emergency
    + ++underlying macroadenoma (~80%)
- medical
    + @pituitary dysfunction == endocrine derangements == %Addisonian crisis/ pan-hypopituitarism
- clinical
    + rf = rf for pituitary macroadenoma + HTN/ bleeding rf
        * treatment for prolactinoma (esp bromocriptine)
        * prior irradiation of macroadenoma
        * Sheehan syndrome
        * htn/ anticoagulation

        * peripheral enhancement around non-enhancing necrotic center
        * %surroudning edema
        * DWI == restricted diffusion in necrotic area
=======
    + cavernoma/ cavernous hemangioma are previous terms, not used as much @these are not neoplastic lesions
    + usu single lesions, @multiple lesions suggest syndrome
- pathophysiology
    + common cerebral vascular malformation w/ thrombosed vessels and surrounding hemosiderin deposition. 
    + unlike AVMs, no normal brain in interstices of the lesions.
    + ++supratentorial
- clinical
    + rf
        * RT, familial/ syndromes
    + presentation
        * usu sx @start 40-60 yrs, but ++%asymptomatic throughout life
        * mass effect/ focal neuro sx/ seizures @temporal location etc
- investigate
    + radio
        * no enhancement on CT, but @large == region of hyperdensity %seen, %see evidence of recent hemorrhage/ edema
        * MRI better, see "popcorn/ berry" w/ rim signal loss @hemosiderin deposition (SWI great for detecting)
        * DSA: CVMs are angiographically occult, w/ no arteriovenous shunting


# Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (CAVMs)
- basics
    + intracranial cerebral vascular malformation of nidus of vessels between feeding artery and vein  
    + 4% of population, symptomatic in 12% in teh affected population
    + congenital/ dysregulation of VEGF
- classification
    + grading
        * 1: size, 2: deep, 3: proximity to important structures.
- pathophysiology
    + feeding arteries dilated @++pressure == aneurysm formation, also ++venous aneurysm (pouches). 
    + %calcification/ gliotic tissue
    + ++@supratentorial,66% superficial
    + 2% multiple AVMs
- clinical
    + presentation
        * mass effect/ focal neurological sx/ raised ICP sx
        * 20%seizures, %ischaemic events sx @vascular steal
- investigate
    + radio
        * vasuclar nidus hyperdense @CT.
        * no mass effect until bleeding occurred
        * CTA == classic bag of worms appearance (total vacular territory becomes obvious)
        * T2 shows flow voids
        * %see previous hemorrhage/ surrounding vasogenic edema

# Posterior circulation CVA syndromes
- basics
    + 20%ischaemic events involve posterior circulation (vertebrobasilar structures)
- related neurological syndromes
    + Gerstmann syndrome (left PCA stroke - dominant hemisphere)
        * (RAAF) right-left disorientation, agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia.
            - get patient to point to R/L limbs, then your limbs
            - get patient to write name
            - get patient to do simple maths, addition etc.
            - get patient to say what finger pointing to (index, ring, middle, etc.), do it with pt eyes closed, tap finger and get pt to say
        * inferior parietal lobule of the dominant hemisphere, which is in the left PCA territory.
    + Right PCA stroke (or non dominant hemishere)
        * (DISC face)
            - dressing apraxia
            - insighting lacking into illness (anosagnosia)
            - spatial neglect
            - constructional apraxia (cannot copy pictures)
            - prosopagnosia

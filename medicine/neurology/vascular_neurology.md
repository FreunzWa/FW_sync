###### Vascular Neurology

# Cerebral Cavernoma (Cerebral cavernous venous malformations)
- Basics
    + ?: cavernoma common, found throughout body.
- investigate  

# Vertebrobasilar aneurysm
- basics
    + vertebrobasilar aneurysm are 10% of brain aneurysms. usu present w/ CN/ brainstem sx @pressure effects. RR hemorrhage < berry aneurysm




# Cerebrovascular accidents 
    ischaemic stroke
    hemorrhagic stroke
        @AVM
        @aneurysmal (eg SAH)


# Subarachnoid hemorrhage
- basics
    + @berry aneurysmal rupture ++@COW bifurcations (PCOM/ ACOM/ MCA bifurcations)
- medical
    + sources of hemorrhage
        * 85%ruptured berry 
        * 10%perimesencephalic hemorrhage
        * %%(AVM, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, ruptured mycotic an, pituitary apoplexy)

        * female
        * smoking, hypertension, family history, alcohol
        * Japanese/ African/ finnish
    + presentation
        * 'thunderclap' headache, worst ever experienced. 50%instant, but may come on over minutes.
        * %seizures/ neck stiffness (usu only after hours @inflam reaction to big hemorrhage in SA space)
    + history
        * 30-50%sentinel headache preceding SAH by up to 20 days
    + exam 
        * ocular
            - %retinal hemorrhages
            - %%vitreous (pre-retinal) hemorrhage [aka Terson syndrome] == ++mortality @means ++rapid increase ICP.
    + investigate
        * protocol
            - CT ==> LP 12 hours after onset of headache @negative CT 
            - ==> %MRI @CT -ve/ LP +ve
        * radio
            - CT: ++SN/SP esp <12 hours, @delay, SN ++falls. @small SAH == %occult. hyperattenuating material @SA space arnd COW or in Sylvian's. (see modified Fisher's scale for grading, predicts vasospasm)
        * LP (better @late presentation @development of xantho)
            - opening pressures
            - red cell count (if no drop between 1st-3rd bottles == SAH diagnosed) but FN @bloody tap.
            - culture (pneumococcal meningitis %p/w thunderclap)
        * xanthochromia
            - 96% SN @ >12 hours after rupture/ headache.  %FP @truamatic tap w/ false xanthochromia @oxyhaemoglobin and delay before analysis.
            - spectrophotometry SN > visual inspection
            
# Perimesencephalic hemorrhage
- basics
    + 10% the cause of SAH, blood collects in basal cisternae, anterior to pons/ midbrain. %involve proximal sylvian's
    + either @venous bleed (non-aneurysmal) or vertebrobasilar aneurysm (==worse prognosis)
- investigate
    + radio
        * CTA to search for aneurysm. @non-aneurysmal == better prognosis

# Pituitary apoplexy
- basics
    + @hemorrhagic necrosis of the pituitary == med emergency
    + ++underlying macroadenoma (~80%)
- medical
    + @pituitary dysfunction == endocrine derangements == %Addisonian crisis/ pan-hypopituitarism

        * treatment for prolactinoma (esp bromocriptine)

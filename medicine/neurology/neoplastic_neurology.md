# Meningioma
- Classification
    + Grade 1 benign (70%)/ Grade 2 Atypical (30%)
- investigate
    + Radio: Features on CT and MRI(T1/2/T1C/DWI/SWI/ADC), C enhancement homogenously, %hyperdense/isodense otherwise, extra-axial, %hyperostosis
    + Radio Signs: dural tail, CSF cleft, white matter buckling, starbust/spokewheel pattern
    + Many atypical imaging appearances
---------------------------------------

# Meningeal Hemangiopericytoma
- Basics
    + ?: prob aggressive version of solitary fibrous tumor of dura. <1% of intracranial tumor
    + prog: ++rate of recurrence, bad.
    + pres: mass effect/ ICP w/ headaches/ focal seizures/ neurological sx
- Treat
    + alg: total surgical excision + catheter embolisation @++bleeding. %radiation adjuvant. 
- investigate
    + radio: usu solitary, extra axial supratentorial mass, lobulated, ++vascular, erode bone, %in occipital, %see bone buckling/ remodelling
    + CT: ++enhancement, bone erosion, NO hyperostosis/ calification
    + MRI: T1/T2 isointense to grey matter, contrast enhance, adjacement edema, ++flow voids on T2
- DDx: 
    + Meningioma/ other dural masses eg solitary fibrous tumor of dura, dural mets, primary dural lymphoma, schwannoma
----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Solitary Fibrous Tumors of the Dura
- basics
    + ?: rare malignant dural masses of mesenchymal origin, closely related but less aggressive than hemangiopericytoma and with less bone erosion
- clinical
    + presentation: mass effect in brain, ++headache
- treat
    + surge: total resection == usu curative, moderate recurrence rates
    + radio: used @recurrence or incomplete surgical resection 
    + prog: better than hemangiopericytoma
- investigate
    + radio
        * signs: yin-yang sign, 
        * CT: well circumscribed, usu hyperdense, %bone erosion and %calcification
        * T1: isointense to normal brain
        * T2: iso-hypointensity signal, yin-yang sign
        * T1C: %%dural tail but this is less common than meningioma, ++enhancement
        * DWI/ADC: regions of restricted diffusion seen
-------------------------------------------------------

# Pilocytic astrocytoma
- basics
    + ?: low grade well defined astrocytomas, usu in young pt. G1 tumors. 
    + common location: cerebellum
- treat
    + prognosis: good @treatment @low grade
    + surge: resection == cure. only need to resect nodule component @cyst walls are non neoplastic
- investigate
    + radio
        * impression: ++@cerebellum, large @diagnosis, fluid filled and solid components.
        * large cystic component w/ enhancing mural nodule, %necrosis, %completely solid. ++%enhances/ %hemorrhage.
        * T1: solid component ~isointense, w/ cystic component
        * T2: cystic omponent gives high signal, solid slightly hyperintense
        * T1C: vivid contrast enhancement, cyyst wall enhancement
-----------------------------------------------------------------

# Glioblastoma (G4 astrocytoma)
- basics
    + ?: ++common astrocytoma intracranial tumor (15% of brain tumors overall), v.aggressive, poor prognosis
- clinical
    + rf: past irradiation, tumor syndromes (NF1/ li frameni, turcot)
- classification
    + histology: 3 variants recognised, giant cell glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, epithelioid glioblastoma
- treat
    + biopsy and tumor debulking + adjuvant stupp
    + stupp protocol (radiotherapy + chemo with temozolomide)
    + followup: 12-24 hours MRI to see residual disease, then every 8-12 weeks after
- investigate  
    + radio
        * usu large @diagnosis, thick, irregular enhancing margins w/ central necrotic core, %hemorrhagic component, surrouned by vasogenic edema. %multifocal
        * CT: irregular thick margins, central hypodensity, vasogenic edema surrounding, enhancment of margins
        * T1: hypo-isointense to white matter
        * T1C: variable enhancement surrounding necrosis
        * T2: hyperintense, with intense vasogenic eedema
        * the more ugly, the worse the prognosis
- DDx: 
    + cerebral mets (may look same, can both be multifocal)
    + primary CNS lymphoma, esp in AIDS
    + cerebral abscess == dual rim sign, SWI low intensity rim
    + Anaplasitc astocytoma
    + tumefactive demyelination
    + subacute cerebral infarction
----------------------------------

# Primary CNS lymphoma
- basics
    + ?: uncommon tumor, 2.5% of all brain tumors.
- clinical
    + rf: HIV/AIDS
    + present: mass effect sx
- Treat
    + symptomatic relief: glucorticoid == ++shrinkage transient == difficult to diagnose immediately. 
    + medication: steroids to shrink tumor mass
    + chemo: MTX 
    + radiation: whole brain irradiation added in pts with high grade tumors
    + prognosis: terrible prognosis, even with treatment.
- Investigate
    + CSF: ++protein/ -=glucose, 
        * %EBV DNA positive
        * positive cytology in only 25%
    + radio
        * often multiple masses, %crossing corpus callosum
        * CT: hyperdense avidly enhancing mass
        * T1: hypointense to grey matter
        * T1C: @high grade == ++enhancement, else low-moderate enhancement
        * T2: usu iso-hypointense to grey matter
        * DWI/ ADC: restricted diffusion
----------------------------------------

# Ganglioglioma
- basics
    + ?: rare tumor of CNS usu in temporal lobes (or else, including spine), usu low grade, more common @children/ young adult
- clinical
    + present: young w/ seizures
- treat
    + surge: total surgical resection if possible, but @abut important esp in spinal cord == recurrence v. likely
    + !radiation therapy == worse outcomes!
    + chemotherapy only @anaplastic ganglioglioma
    + prognosis: good @total resection
- investigate
    + radio
        * impression: looks well demarc, variable location/ contrast enhance, indistinctive
        * very variable, usu in temporal lobe, but can be found everywhere, %cystic, with enhancing mural nodule, or simply solid mass. 
        * CT: iso-hypodense, 35%calcified, 50%enhanced @solid non calcified component
        * T1: solid component iso-hypointense 
        * T2: hyperintense solid component
        * T1C: solid component variable contrast enhancement

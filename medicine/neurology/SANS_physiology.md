# beta adrenergic receptors
- b1 receptors
    + GPCR associated w/ Gs G-protein
    + functions
        * cardiac muscle/ pacemaker   
            - ++inotropic on myocardium
            - ++chronotropic @SA node, @AV node (++conduction velocity)
        * bladder
            - causes relaxation of detrusor
        * kidney JGA
            - renin release
        * salivary glands
            - viscuous amylase filled salivary secretions
        * adipose
            - lipolysis
- b2 receptors





# RAAS
- @-=in renal perfusion (either @volume depletion or hypotension) detected at the JGA or activation of JGA @SANS activation through b1 receptors. == pro-renin produced @JGA cleaved into renin
- renin == AT produced @liver cleaved to decapeptide AT1 == ACE in the lungs converts AT1 to octapeptide AT2. ACE actually in many other tissues including glomerulus.
- AT2 functions: (reverse hypotension to increase GFR)
* arteriolar vasoconstriction == ++TPR == ++SBP
* tubular Na+Cl-/ H20 reabsorption and K+ excretion.
* aldosterone secretion (a powerful mineralocorticoid)
* ADH secretion @posterior pituitary
* SANS activation
chronic detrimental effects: 
* inflammatory mediator (ROS, ICAMs, VCAMs, proinflammatory effect on leukocytes)
* ++cellular proliferation of vessels == ?atherogenesis
* may contribute to insulin resistance

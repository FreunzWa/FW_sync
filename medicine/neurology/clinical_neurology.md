###### Clinical Neurology

# Motor disorders
- Apraxia
    + posterior parietal cortex damage == loss of ability to execute learned purposeful movements
        * subtypes: (apraxia of speech, gait apraxia, oculomotor apraxia)
        * usu @lesion in dominant (left) hemisphere in frontal/ parietal lobe @stroke/ dementia/ brain injury

# Nystagmus
- rhythmic regular oscillation of the eyes, either continuous or paroxysmal (eg @triggers of certain head movements @involvement of the vestibular system)
- types:
    + jerk: (alternating phases of slow drift with corrective quick jerks)
    + pendular: (slow pendular oscillations in both directions)
- classified according to trajectory:
    + downbeat/ upbeat/ horizontal/ torsional/ mixed (direction named is of the fast jerk phase)
- medical
    + jerk nystagmus @asymmetry of vestibular inputs (either @CNS or PANS)
- associated features
    + ++vertigo 
    + blurred vision, abnormal head positions (patient attempts to minimise nystagmus by assuming certain head positins)
- treating the symptom  
    + medication
    + botox injections
    + prism lenses and optical solutions
    + surgery (shifting the attachment of muscles)

# Headache
- description  
    + location:
        * holocranial (affecting the entire head)
        * focal 

# Pyramidal vs. Extra-pyramidal signs
- pyramidal involves the corticobulbar and the corticospinal tract (motor symptoms @dysfunction, including paresis, dysreflexia)
- extrapyramidal symptoms (drug induced pyramidal symptoms, movement disorders)

###### Traumatic brain injury

- basics
    + cerebral pathology/ dysfunction due to external force transferred to cranial contents
- mechanisms
    + shearing mechanisms (leading to DAI)
    + contusion ()


# Classification 
- severity
    + use GCS 


# Pathophysiology
- primary injury
    + intra/ extra-parenchymal hemorrhages (including epidural/ subdural/ intraventricular)
    + diffuse axonal injury 
    + contusion (esp seen in frontal and temporal areas)
    + traumatic SAH
    + 
- secondary injury  
    + @cascade of molecular injury mechanisms continue for hours-days after the initial insult. outcomes modifiable @attention to reducing seizures, hypoxia, fever, hypotension.
        * @Nt mediated excitotoxivty @++glutamate accumulation in cells, a free radical == apoptosis/ inflammatory responses.
        * electrolyte derangement, Mt dysfunction
        * %secondary ischaemia from vasospasm 

#  Diffuse axonal injury 
- basics 
    + diffuse axonal injury to white matter tracts, visualisd by white matter lesions on MRI, esp involving the grey white junction.


# Post traumatic amnesia
- fatigue, altered sleep wake cycle, poor attention,includes loss of conscious, irritability. 
- westmead pta scale (12 qeustions, 7 tesiting orientation, 5 assessing memory). out of PTA when 12/12 3 days in a row. 
- agitation 
- pharmacological therapy
    + propranolol
    + mood stabilisers
    + no benzos/ antipsychotics @may exacerbate


# Other complications
- post traumatic hydrocephalus
- infections
- seizures
- delirium
- incontinence
- DVT/ PE
- hetertropic ossification (@immobiltiy == bone growing outisde of the joints). use PT and NSAIDs. ortho @restcting movemetn.
- spasticity

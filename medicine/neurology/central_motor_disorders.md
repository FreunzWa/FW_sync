        Spastic, Athetoid, Ataxic


# Multiple system atrophy (MSA)
- basics
    + rare neurodegenerative disorder ^motor features of parkinsonism, dysautonomia. @specific degeneration of SN, inferior olivary nucleus, cerebellum.
    + brings together a group of 3 neurodegenerative syndromes 
        * striatonigral degeneration
        * shy-dager syndorme
        * olivopontocerebellar atrophy
- medical
    + unknown cause, possibly alpha-synuclein
    + associated conditions
        * depression
        * RP
        
- clinical
    + classification
        * MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P): more common in Europe
        * MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C): more common in Japan
    + presentation
        * Parkinson's features
            - postural
                + camptocormia (severe ant flexion of spine)
                + anterocollis
                + pisa syndrome (subacute axial dystonia w/ lateral flexion)
        * Cerebellar features
            - gait ataxia, limb ataxia, ataxic scanning dysarthria, cerebellar disturbances or eye movements. gaze evoked nystagmus, saccadic intrusion, ocular dysmetria. 
        * Dysautonomic features (occur in MSA much earlier on than they do in PD)
            - Almost all men develop early ED
            - urination: voiding difficulty, nocturia, incontinence, diurnal frequency, nocturnal enuresis.
            - orthostatic hypotension (usu after urinary sx)
        * Other features
            - Dysphagia 
            - OSA, central sleep apnoea, stridor, nightmares
            - cognitive fx well preserved, but %affected esp late stage.
            - olfactory function usu preserved as opposed to PD
- investigate
    + radio
        * MRI == atrophy of putamen/ pons/ middle cerebellar peduncle. hot cross bun sign (non specifci)
    + l-dopa trial  
        * MSA is non responsive to L-DOPA+Carbidopa (@distinguish MSA-P from PD). or may be init repsonsive and then unresponsive.
- diagnosis criteria
    + sporadic progressive adult onset disease ^:
        * Parkinsonism (refractory to L-DOPA therapy) OR cerebellar syndrome
        * 1+ feature suggesting Dysautonomia
        * At least one addition feature of MSA
- treat
- ddx
    + idiopathic parkinsons disease
        * lack of sustained rponse to L-DOPA/ carbidopa
        * more dysautonomia
        * MSA has more postural trmeor, ataxia esp in MSA-C
    + atypical parkinson syndromes (mainly CBS and PSP)
        * PSP (look for vertical eye movement dysfunction)
        * CBS (look for apraxia)
    + dementia with lew bodies
    + late onset Friedreich's ataxia


# Cerebral Palsy (CP)
- basics
    + heterogenous group of conditions w/ permanent non progressive motor dysfunction == affects tone, posture/ movement. 
    + @damage to develoiping fetal/ infantile brain
    + usu pw rigidity/ hypotonicitiy, defecits with vision, dysphagia, tremors, hearing, speaking, postural and gait abn, %cognitive issues/ seizures. 
    + avg diagnosed at 18-24 months.
- clinical
    + rf
        * being a twin
        * preterm birth
        * pregnancy exposure to toxoplasmosis/ rubella/ methymerfcury/ difficult delivery/ head trauma during first few years.
        * 2% thought to be genetic
        * low birth weight, 
    + presentation
        * neurobehavioural signs
            - excessive docility or irritabiltity.
            - poor feeding
            - baby sleeps poorly, vomits freqeuently. 
            - poor visual attention
        * milestones
            - delay in sitting, walking, delayed hand preference
        * developmental reflexes
            - delay in disappearance of a developmental reflex (tonic neck, gallant, tonic labyrinthine)
        * neurological
            - abn tone (increase/ decreased/ or %normal)
- medical
    + associated conditions
        * chronic pain (50-75%)
        * intellectual disability (50%)
        * epilepsy (25-40%)
        * bvladder control, visual impairment, hearing impairments
- classification
    + main classes (can usually categorise at arnd 24 mnths)
        * spastic CP (hypertonicity of muscles @UMN like syndrome)
            - %symmetric/ asymmetric.
            - hypertonia, hyperreflexia, clonus, extensor plantar reponses
            - impaired fine motor functio, slow effortful voluntary movements
            - subcategories (spastic diplegia, hemiplegia, quadriplegia)
        * ataxic CP (poor coordination, gait issues)
            - slow, jerky, explosive speech
            - ataxic CP is rare. 
        * athetoid CP (writhing movements)
            - presence of involuntary movements
            - choreoathetosis, dystonia
    + however CP may evolve overtime, and have feature from different classes
    + use the  gross motor fucntion classification system

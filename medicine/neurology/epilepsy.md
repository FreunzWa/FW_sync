    Status epilepticus during sleep 
        Landau-Kleffner syndrome

# Status epilepticus during sleep (ESES) - the 'sleepilepsies'
- for diagnosis requires >85% of REM sleep to have continuouis epileptiform activity

# Landau-Kleffner syndrome {sleepilepsy affecting language}
- basics
    + LKS is a epilepsy syndrome with status epilepticus during sleep
    + children with LKS develop normally until 3-6, when they lose expressive language function. auditory verbal agnosia (children behave as if they are deaf)
    + later onset than autism, which is a differential
- medical
    + epileptiform waves arise in the language centres == clinical seizures and epilepticus status duiring sleep == prevetns development of expressivre/ sensory language function.
- clinical
    + presentation
        * 75%  have clinical seizures, normally not severe. 
- ix
    + EEG
        * shows bilateral centrotemporal spikes and sharp waves with fields spread widely through both hemispehres. 
        * @sleeping == becomes epileptiform activity becomes continuous (electrical status epilepticus during sleep ESES). 
    + NMED
        * shows that the epileptiform activity begins @the language centre and spreads to the contralateral cortex

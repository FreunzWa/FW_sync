# beta adrenergic receptors
- b1 receptors
    + GPCR associated w/ Gs G-protein
    + functions
        * cardiac muscle/ pacemaker   
            - ++inotropic on myocardium
            - ++chronotropic @SA node, @AV node (++conduction velocity)
        * bladder
            - causes relaxation of detrusor
        * kidney JGA
            - renin release
        * salivary glands
            - viscuous amylase filled salivary secretions
        * adipose
            - lipolysis
- b2 receptors
    + GPCR associated w/ adenylate cyclase == ++cAMP == L-type Calcium channel activation. classic FoF response activation.
    + functions
        * smooth muscle relaxation
            - GI tract (inhibit digestion)/ bronchi (++respiration)/ detrusor muscle of the bladder (inhibit micturition)/ uterus/ seminal tract
        * blood vessel dilation (++perfusion to skeletal muscles)
        * striated muscle ++contractility (skeletal muscle ++contraction/ motility)
        * pancreas (++insulin and glucagon secretion == ++uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle)
        * ++glycogenolysis (++glucose available)
        * ++tremor
- b3 receptors
    + located mainly @adipose and skeletal muscle
    + also located @gall bladder, urinary bladder
    + functions
        * adipose: ++lipolysis
        * skeletal: ++thermogenesis



# RAAS
- @-=in renal perfusion (either @volume depletion or hypotension) detected at the JGA or activation of JGA @SANS activation through b1 receptors. == pro-renin produced @JGA cleaved into renin
- renin == AT produced @liver cleaved to decapeptide AT1 == ACE in the lungs converts AT1 to octapeptide AT2. ACE actually in many other tissues including glomerulus.
- AT2 functions: (reverse hypotension to increase GFR)
* arteriolar vasoconstriction == ++TPR == ++SBP
* tubular Na+Cl-/ H20 reabsorption and K+ excretion.
* aldosterone secretion (a powerful mineralocorticoid)
* ADH secretion @posterior pituitary
* SANS activation
chronic detrimental effects: 
* inflammatory mediator (ROS, ICAMs, VCAMs, proinflammatory effect on leukocytes)
* ++cellular proliferation of vessels == ?atherogenesis
* may contribute to insulin resistance


# Muscarinic receptors
- M1 receptors (CNS)
    + functions
        * CNS
            - slow after depolarising potentials in neurons
        * ANS
            - EPSP in autonomic ganglia
        * GI
            - ++exocrine secretions (salivary glands adn stomach)
- M2 receptors (cardiac)
    + functions
        * cardiac (dominates over sympathetic activity)
            - -=HR
            - -=contractility of atria
            - -=conduction velocity of AV node
- M3 receptors (lung, all over body)
    + functions
        * respiratory
            - bronchoconstriction
        * GI
            - ++exocrine secretions (salivary glands adn stomach)
            - emesis
        * eye
            - accomodation
            - lacrimation
        * vascular
            - ++intarcellular calcium in vascular endothelium
            - vasodilation @+=synthesis of Nitric Oxide
- M4 receptors (CNS)
    + CNS
        * decreased locomotion
- M5 receptors (CNS)
    + in CNS

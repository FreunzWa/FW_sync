# Aphasia/ Language OSCE

# Approach
- characterise the speech/ language defecit
- rule out:
    + alterred conscious state (delirium/ schizophrenia/ severe depression)
    + dysarthria/ dysphonia
- characterise the defecit
    + facilitate free speech
    + test comprehension (eg. touch your chin, 1-3rd order instructions)
    + repetition (repeat no ifs, ands, or buts)
    + name two different objects pointed at (eg wristwatch)
- broadly characterise into:
    + expressive/ receptive/ conduction/ anomic/ global 
- assess for presence of:
    + Gerstmann syndrome (left domainant inferior parietal lobe) - RAAF
- examination
    + allow free speech @non-obvious abnormality (eg ask the patient to describe daily activities/ room/ clothes)

#### Rule out:
# Dysarthria
- @no disorder of language but @damage to articulation areas:
    + UMNLs of the cranial nerves, extrapyramidal conditions (PD), cerebellar lesions (scanning speech)
    + pseudobulbar palsy (sounds like pt trying to squeeze words out of tight lips @paralysis of facia lmuscles @infarction of internal capulses)

# Dysphonia
- eg @larngyeal disease @viral infection/ tumor/ iatrogenic.

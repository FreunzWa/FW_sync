# Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)
- basics
    + pathologically increased ventricle size with normal opening pressures @LP.
- class
    + idiopathic (primary)
    + secondary NPH
- medical
    + idiopathic mx
        * cerebrovascular disease (periventricular ischaemia == ++compliance of ventircular wall == dilatation of ventricles. also @-=venous flow == -=CSF uptake)
        * decompensated congenital hydrocephalus (NPH from birth that only later becomes symptomatic)
        * decreased CSF absorption (eg @++central venous pressure leading to valvular incompentence)
    + 2ndary mx
        * intraventricular/ SAH
        * prior actue/ ongoing chronic meningtiis
        * paget disease at skull base
    + clinical manifestation mx
        * thought to be @periventircular white matter tract dysfunction ++those connected to forntal lobes
- clinical
    + rf
        * vascular risk factors, hypertension etc are assoc with NPH.
    + presentation (classic triad) %have all three {Wet, Wacky, Wobbly}
        * gait apraxia (the predominant problem)
            - a frontal ataxia causing 'glue-footed gait', taking small steps w/ wide base w/ difficulty turning.++risk of fall.
        * urinary incontinence
            - usu develops from urgency in the early stages.
        * dementia/ congnitive disturbance
            - evolves over months to years. usu develops after gait.
            - apathy, impaired exec function, decreased attention/ concentration
    + importantly, negative findings assoc with ICP
- treat
    + surge: placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt
- ddx
    + must distinguish from other dementias (as ventricles often increase anyway with age): esp P-plus syndromes, CBS, PSP, MSA. Consider AD, FTD, VaD
- investigate
    + radio
        * MRI: shows ventriculomegaly out of proportion to sulcal enlargement with no obvious obstruction of 3rd/ 4th ventricles. disproportionate enlargement to distinguish from dementia/ age related coritcal atrophgy.

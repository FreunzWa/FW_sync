# Limbic encephalitis
- basics
    + inflammation of the limbic system (hippocampus, amygala, hypothalamus, cingulate, limbic cortex)
    + classically a paraneoplastic encephalitis, but can be autoimmune based as well
    + manifests with subacute mood and behavioural changes
- medical
    + etiologies
        * generally a paraneoplastic phenomenon, can be associated with underlying SCLC, seminoma, testicular tumors, thymoma, breast cancer, HL. generally neurological sx precede discovery of the tumor. 
- clinical
    + presentation 
        * short term memory dysfunction, focal seizures, complex partial seizures, cognitive dysfunction
        * hypothalamic dysfunction: hyperthermia, somnolence, endocrine abnormalities
- investigations
    + EEG findings: generalised slowing/ epileptiform activity maximal @temporal
    + MRII: FLAIR intensification in temporal lobes (associated with edema), -=contrast enhancement. PET shows hjypermetabolism in medial temporal obes.
    + LP: ++have anti-Hu or CRMP5 autoantibodies in CSF
    + Serum studies:
        * ++% positive anti-Hu or CRMP5 autoabs

###### Dysphasias

# Differentials
    Non-fluent
        Comprehending
            Broca's aphasia ('non-fluent aphasia')
            Transcortical motor aphasia
        Non-comprehending   
            Global aphasia
            Mixed transcortical aphasia
    Fluent
        Comprehending
            Conduction aphasia
            Anomic aphasia
        Non-comprehending
            Transcortical sensory aphasia
            Wernicke's aphasia ('fluent aphasia')

# Theory
- most are left hemisphere dominant for language function (influenced by dominant hand). or @developmental abnormalities == contralateral lateralisation
- etiologies: 
    + acute: ++ischaemic/ hemorrhagic stroke, cererbal abcess, other mass lesion, MS, disseminated encaphlomyelitis
    + transient abnormalities @seizure/ migraine/ TIA
    + progressive: neurodegenerative diseases (eg AD), CJD

# Differentiating aphasia from other underlying causes
- exclude
    + delirium
    + shizophrenia (may mimic a fluent aphasia)
    + dysarthria
    + apraxia of speech (motor disorder - can be difficult to distinguish frmo broca's)

# Assessing fluency
- Following qualities are used to grade fluency of speech
    + Sparse output (decreased number of WPM)
    + shortended phrases (<5 words)
    + agrammatism (ommision of function words, most specific feature of dysfluency)
    + effortfulness (hesitations and disruption of the normal meldoic rhythm)
    + breakdown of speech praxis (inability to coordiacte articulartion). - get patient to repeat syllables 'pa-ta-ka'

# Other abnormalities which may be present
- paraphasia (production of unintended syllables, words, or phrases during the effort of speech)
- echolalia: meaningless repitition of another person's spoken words as a symptom of psychiatric disorders
- anomia: unable to recall the names of everyday objects
- circumlocution: substituting words and phrases (eg @anomia since cannot remember specific words)


# Components of speech
- phoneme: sound that separates one word from another
- morpheme: unit of language that cannot be further divided (eg 'in' in 'income')


# Broca's aphasia (non-fluent aphasia)
- sparse output, agrammatism, w/ repaired repetition.
- writing affected in proportion to speech

# Wernicke's aphasia (fluent aphasia)
- fluent aphasia w/ markedly impaired comprehension. 
- speech voluminous but meaningless, with ++paraphasic rrors, neologisms. 'word salad'
- speech retains normal cadence and intonation. 
- patient seems unaware of the deficit

# Conduction aphasia
- fluent aphasia with impaired repitition, frequent paraphasic errors. patient keeps trying to correct errors.
- may emerge during the context of recovering from Wernicke's diseaes

# Global aphasia
- deficits in all language functions, patients are often mute, or only non word utterances. 
- expression and reception impaired. cannot follow commands. 
- usu @extensive perisylvian injuries, affecting both Broca and Wernicke's so usu associated with right visual field deficit and right hemiparesis.

# Transcortical motor aphasia
- non-fluent speech output, problem initiating speech / completing a thought. 
- good comprehension and repitition
- can occur as a primary deficit/ when recovering from broca's. 
- thought to be afected @anterior cebral artery strokes

# Transcortical sensory aphasia
- fluent aphasia w/ paraphasic errors, impaired comprehension
- similar to wernicke's
- intact repitition (as opposed to wernicke's)

# Transcortical mixed aphasia
- all features of global aphasia except repitition is spared
- no spontaneous verbal speech but may repeat what has just been said. 
- @give common phrase are sometimes able to finish of the sentence. 

# anomic aphasia
- anomia occurs in most aphasia syndomres, but may in some cases be an isolated deficit. 
- in anomic aphasia, there is isolated anomia, speech has circumlocution (substitution of words and phrases), pauses, %paraphasic errors

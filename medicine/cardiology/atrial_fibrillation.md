###### Atrial fibrillation

# Basics
- most common suistained arrhythmia with irregularly irregular ventricular beats @fibrillating atria == essentially random summation of impulses to provide ventricular depolarisation through the AV node. 
- may be paroxysmal, chronic, %have rapid ventricular response (not rate controlled)
- AF is common @post-surgery (10-40%, typically on day 2-3)

# Treatment 
- Resuscitation
- Treat cause @secondary AF (eg @innapropriate medication)
- Patient differences:
    + @ICU, many pt develop pAF @other illnesses eg hypoxia/ sepsis transiently, may not need to anticoagulate.
- Rate control (for AF w/ rapid venticular response)
    + B-blocker, Calcium blocker for paroxysmal AF (not in people with WPW or decomp heart failure)
    + IV amiodarine in the critically ill
    + @heart failure == digoxin + BB
    + digoxin no that effective generally, esp in the critically ill @++sympathetic tone.
- Rhythm control
    + DC cardioversion, esp @unstable patients
    + maintaining sinus rhythm:
        * amiodarone
        * disopyramide
        * flecainide
        * sotalol
- Anticoagulation
    + unless anticoagulation contraindicated (eg @bleeding risk, recent brain surgery etc.)
    + @<48 hours of AF:
        * score = 0 == no anticoagulation necessary
        * score > 0 == therapeutic anticoagulation w/ IV heparin or enox
    + @>48 hours of AF:
        * score = 1 == aspirin is a reasonable choice
        * score > 1 == warfarin or equivalent to maintain INR 2-3 (or APTT equivalent). warfarin remains most effective.
            - note warfarin + aspirin not shown benefit over warfarin alone
- Ablation therapy indicated @one of the following:
    + permanent AF where rate difficult to control and symptomatic
    + rate related cardiomyopathy @AF
    + refractory symptomatic paroxysmal AF

# Medical
- types of AF
    + temporal
        * chronic/ paroxysmal
    + ventricular response rate
        * rapid
        * slow (often @severe AV noidal disease, medication toxicity or hypothermia)
- complications of AF
    + thromboembolic stroke
        * risk calculated @CHA2DS2VASC calculation

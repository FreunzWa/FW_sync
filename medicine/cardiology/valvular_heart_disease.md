###### Valvular heart disease

# Aortic stenosis (AS)
- basics
- medical
    + cx
        * Heyde's syndrome: unfolding of vWF @++shear forces associated with stenotic aortic valve == vWF broken down @vulnerable to ADAMTS13 == -=vWF in the blood. == ++bleeding risk, @pre-existing AVM in the GIT (esp stomach) == ++bleeding from those AVMs. (?vWF decreased questioned to cause ++angiodysplasia formation @++Rate of AVMs in AS patients)

# Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (aka libman-sacks endocarditis) NBTE
- basics   
    + rare, non infectious platelet thrombi on heart valves esp @malignancy/ SLE
- clinical
    + presentation
        * usu asymptomatic w/ no murmurs/ no sx of valvular dysfunction/ heart failure
        * sx of underlying condition
        * sx of infarction complication
- medical
    + mx
        * especially affects aortic and mitral valves
        * thought to be endothelial injury in setting of hypercoagulable state
    + etiology
        * 80%advanced malignancy 
        * SLE
        * %APS
        * rheumatic heart disease
        * RA
        * Sepsis
        * burns
    + complications
        * higher risk of embolisation in NBTE @less inflammation so ++dislodge == extensive infarction (brain, digits, kidneys, GIT)
    + poor prognosis @associated with underlying malignancy/ often asymptomatic until massive infarct.
- investigate
    + rule out infection w/ 3x bottles of cultures
    + ix for underlying causes (eg APS, malignancy, SLE)
    + TTE (to visualise the valvular vegetations), proceed to TOE @negative.
- treat
    + systemic anticoagulation, treatment of underlying condition
        * @no contraindication == warfarin 2-3, aspirin/ LMWH
        * risk hemorrhagic conversion of ischaemic events.
        * should continue anticoagulation long term.
    + usu no surgical debridement

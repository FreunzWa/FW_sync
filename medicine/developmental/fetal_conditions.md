###### Fetal conditions

# Hydrops fetalis
- basics
    + fetal edema in at least 2 compartments of the fetus (soft tissue and serous cavitiies)
    + is caused @anaemia, and is either immune/ non-immune mediated
    + ~1/2000 births
- types
    + immune mediated
        * @Rh disease == severe fetal anaemia
    + non-immune mediated (causes not @red cell allo-immunisation)
        * Fe deficiency
        * paroxysmal SVT
        * CMV in mother
        * alpha thalassaemia
        * Turner syndrome
        * tumors
        * maternal hyperthyroidism
        * noonan syndrome
        * down syndrome
- medical
    + @fetal anaemia (@immune/ non-immune anaemia) == ++HR to compensate == eventual decompenstation and cardiac failure == fluid overload and edema as a consequence.
- investigate
    + diagnosed @USS scans, combined with doppler imaging. 
        * look for: fetal ascites, pleural effusion, subcut fluid, pericardial effusion, skin edema
- treatment
    + @severe anaemia == can be improved with blood transfusions (esp those with Rh disease and alpha thalassamia major)

# Mirror syndrome (aka Ballantyne syndrome)
- basics
    + rare disorder when there is an association between fetal/ placental hydrops with maternal pre-eclampsia

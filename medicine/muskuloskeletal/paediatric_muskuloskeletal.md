###### Paediatric Muskuloskeletal

Normal Anatomy/ Physiology
--------------------------

# Ossification centres
- Elbow ossification
    + highly reliable (capitulum  --> radial head --> medial epicondyle --> trochlea --> olecranon --> lateral epicondyle)
        * Most important to remember the I and the T. If see a trochlea but no medial epicondyle, must look very hard for an avulsed ossification centre == migration. requires internal fixation == get ortho!
        * Age of Oss centres (1,5,7,10,10,11)
- Proximal femur
    + shaft (7 weeks in utero), head (4-6 months), greater trochanter (2-4 years), lesser trochanter (puberty), fuse between 14-18 years 
- Pelvis
    + ilium (8 weeks utero), ischium (4-6 months in utero), pubis (4-6 months in utero), 2 centres of the acetabulum in puberty. 3 components fuse @7-9 years. acetabuluar fusion of the triradiate cartilage occurs at 20-25 years







Pathology

# Fractures
- Saltar harris fracture types (physeal fractures and management)
- Fractures involving ossification centres
    + Elbow fractures (w/ ossification centres)

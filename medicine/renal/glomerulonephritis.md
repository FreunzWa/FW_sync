###### Glomerulonephritis
- basics
    + clinical presentation/ histology/ dependent on primary structures affected by the inflammation. 
    + classification:
        * Nephritic syndrome (damage to glomerular vascular endothelium)
        * Nephrotic syndrome (damage to podocytes and the BM)

# Approach/ Classification
    Nephrotic syndrome
        Minimal change disease  
        Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
        Membranous nephropathy
        Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
    Nephritic syndrome
        Most common
            IgA nephropathy (++@developed regions)
            Post-streptococcal (Post-infectious) GN (++@developing regions)
        Hemolytic Uraemic Syndrome
        Henoch Schonlein purpura
        Alport Syndrome
        Thin basement membrane nephropathy
        Membranoproliferative GN
        Goodpasture syndrome 
        SLE nephritis
        Infective endocarditis
        Rapidly progressive GN (crescenteric)
---------------------------------------------

# Nephritic syndrome
- mx
    + inflammatory damage to glomerular vascular endothelium
- presentation (Triad)
    + dysmorphic haematuria (vascular damage == blood escapes)
    + hypertension (due to renal failure)
    + oliguria (due to renal failure)
    + also azotemia, variable proteinuria, edema

-----------------------------------------------------------


# IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease)
- basics
    + @++IgA == ++collection @kidney == complement mediated inflammatory nephritis == GN syndrome <5 days of URTI
    + most common, and usually fairly self limiting with supportive therapy. 
    + peak 10-30 years of age.
    + rare form of aggressie bergers can be life threatening @severe renal injury.
    + may individuals have mesangial IgA deposition, but only a small percentage of these will have actual glomerular damage.
- clinical
    + may be recurrent, with previous similar episodes.
    + rf:
        * M:F=2:1
    + presentation
        * %asymptomatic "latent" (but +ve on biopsy)
        * usu <5 days after episode off URTI (including tonsillitis/ viral upper respiratory tract infection)
        * 40-50% episodic gross haematuria (brown urine) @viral URTI
        * %loin pain
        * %low grade fever
        * %HTN/ oliguria
        * peripheral edema/ fluid overload sx
- ix
    + urinalysis: microhaematuria/ %albuminuria, mild proteinuria, microscopy shows glomerular RBCs + cast formation
    + radio
        * USS + cystoscopy to confirm haematuria source, r/o calc/ TCC
    + biopsy
        * confirms diagnosis: mesangial IgA deposits. @IgG codeposition == worse outcomes. 
- rx
    + prognosis: CKD progression in most, often decades after init present

# Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN)
- basics
    + more common @developing areas.
    + incidence highest in children 5-12 years, adults >60.
- medical
    + mx
        * specific beta hemolytic GAS strains == induce immune complex formation with strep antigenic components.
        * abs that bind to streptococcal antigens cross react with glomerular components (molecular mimicry)
        * two strep antigens which are nephritogenic have been proposed:
            - nephritis associated plasmin receptor
            - streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B
    + cx
        * may manifest as a rapidly progressive form (crescenteric) which is severe and life threatening. <0.5% of cases.
- investigations
    + bloods    
        * inflammatory markers, RF+ve @2/3 of patients.
- patients
    + history
        * antecedent history of skin infection/ throat infection, usually >5 days.
    + presentation
        * mild-severe presentation
        * %red-brown urine, proteinuria, edema, elevation in serum creatinine @fluid retention.
        * 50-90% hypertension




# Nephrotic syndrome
- mx
    + inflammatory damage to podocytes/ BM == proteinuria
- presentation 
    + proteinuria (>3.5 g/day), hypoalbuminaemia, lipiduria, hyperlipidaemia

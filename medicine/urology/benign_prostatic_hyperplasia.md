###### BPH
- basics
    + benign hyperplasia of the prostate gland, increases as men age == obstructive symptoms of urination.
- presentation
    + storage symptoms (diurinarl frequency, nocturia, urinary incontinence "overflow")
    + obstructive (urgency, weak stream, dribbling, hesitancy)
    + %irritatitive symptoms (@OAB syndrome 2nd to obstruction)
    + history
        * urethral trauma/ urethritis/ surgery 
        * gross haematuria/ bladder pain
        * neurological diseaes (neurogenic bladder)
        * smoking (bladder Ca)
        * anticholinergic agents (causing decreased UO)
    + examination
        * do not need DRE @findings may not correlate with sx. however @rule out prostatitis, necessary.
- medical
    + mx
        * hyerplasia involving the transitional zone of the prostate
        * not belived to be a RF for prostate cancer
    + natural hx
        * sx may resolve over time, gradually worsen 
        * cx: bladder outlet obstruction, post renal failure, acute urinary retention, recurrent infections
- diagnosis
    + differential
        * stricture, bladder neck contracture, prostate cnacer (usu asymptomatic), UTI/ acute prostattis, neurogenic bladder
- investigations
    + IPSS (international prostate symptom score)
        * indication of severity of symptoms, and can be used to determine success of treatment.
    + post void residual volume
        * USS or in out catheterisation. normal <12 ml. however usu not concerning until 100-200ml
    + urinalysis (for haematuria - bladder Ca)
    + serum Creatinine (bladder obstruction/ Renal damage)
    + PSA testing @suspcious
    + USS (obstruction, renal damage)
    + urethrocystocopy (differentiate bladder Ca, urethral stricture,)
    + urodynamics (urinary flow rate/ pressure flow studies)
- treatment
    + only require treatment @symptomatic presentation, or evidence of complications of bladder outlet obstruction (renal insufficiency, recurrent infection)
    + who:
        * refer to urologist @complciations of BPH appear (urinary retention/ post renal failure/ bladder outlet obstruction)
    + non pharmacological
        * voiding in the sitting position
        * avoiding fluids prior to bedtime
        * reduce consumption of mild diuretics (alcohol and coffee)
        * double voiding (reducee residual urinary volume)
    + pharmacological   
        * classes
            - Alpha-1-adrenergic antagonists
                + use for initial monotherapy for IPSS <19 (symptomatic BPH)
                + cause relaxation of bladder detrusor
                + may improve symptoms fairly immediately
                + however may be poorly tolerated which may limit use.
            - 5-alpha-reductase inhibitiors
                + works by reducing prostate size, so takes months to have an effect on the symptoms
                + reduce long term potential need for prostate surgery. 
                + examples: Finasteride, Dutasteride (very similar)
            - Anticholinergics
                + primarily for use in men with predominantly bladder overactivity symptoms
                + ses anticholinergic side effects
            - PDE-5 inhibitors
                + tadalafil
                + only for men with coexisting ED + mild to moderate BPH symptoms. (IPSS < 20). should not be combined without due consideration with alpha 1 blockers @risk of severe hypotension.
        * initial monotherapy
            - use alpha 1 blockers, followed by 5-alpha reductase inhibitors if alpha 1 blockers are not tolerated.
        * dual therapy (IPSS >= 20)
            - combination therapy of alpha 1 blocker and 5-alpha reductase inhibitor.
            - may combine alpha 1 blocker with anticholinergic @irritattive symptom and low postvoid residual volumes.      
    + surgical
        * TURP (transurethral resection of prostate)
        * vaporisation techniques
        * diathermy techniques
        * embolisation (investigational)


# IPSS
- scoring system for grading the severity of symptoms associated with urinary obstruction
- standardised questionnaire about symptoms and quality of life
- interpretation
    + <8 (mild)
    + 8-19 (moderate)
- the IPSS can influence and guide treatment, depending on which degree of severity the patient experiences obstructive symptoms.

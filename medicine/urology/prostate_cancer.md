###### Prostate Cancer

# Types of prostate cancer
    Acinar adenocarcinoma (most common)
    Ductal adenocarcinoma 
    Transitional cell cancer
    Squamous cell cancer
    Small cell prostate cancer (NET)
    Rare (carcinoid, sarcoma)

# Acinar adenocarcinoma
- 95% of prostate malignancies.

# Prostatic carcinoid tumor
- @well differentiated prostate malignancy

- basics
    + 2nd most common cancer in men
    + lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer ~16%, risk of dying only 2.9% many prostate cancer types are very slow growing and are not the eventual cause of death.
- investigations
    + screening
        * PSA testing (normal <4.0 ng/ml) a titre higher than 10 ng/ml more suspcious for invasive metastatic cancer

# Treatment of Prostate Cancer
- risk stratificiation (determine treatment)
    + TNM staging (on biopsy and imaging). (%positive biopsiess)
    + histological grade (Gleason score. up to 10 points, 5 groups)
    + serum PSA
    + genomic testing (may provide aditional information)
    + estimated outcomes/ complications with each treatment group
    + patient's general medical health/ individual preferences
- 


# Histological grading system
- correlates closely with clinical presentation.
- Gleason grading system
    + grades 1-5, 5 being the least differentiated
- Composite Gleason score
    + add the score of the two most prevalent differentiation patterns.
    + diagnosis of prostate cancer is not given if the score is below 6. (scores thus range from 6-10)
    + The first number is the most prevalent pattern, the second number is the 2ndary pattern. 
- Grade Group system
    + Grade group 1: <=6 (though 6 is considered cancer, early form). 
    + Grade group 2: 3+4 
    + Grade group 3: 4+3 (always treatment warranted)
    + Grade group 4: 4+4/ 5+3/ 3+5
    + Grade group 5: 9 to 10
- Gleason score 6, GG 1 (3+3)
    + definitely early stages of prostatic adenocarcinoma, most common. 3 is very benign, indolent, doesnt require treatment.
    + %%progress to gleason 7 or higher grading levels.
    + sampling error may cause lack of sampling of higher grade tumor areas.

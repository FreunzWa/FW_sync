###### Prostatitis

# Acute bacterial prostatitis
- basics
    + acute bacterial infection in prostate ++@bacteria through urethra @STI
- mx
    + cx
        * may progress to chronic prostatitis @suboptimal treatment of acute prostatitis.
- medical
    + cx    
        * prostatic abscess, epididymitis, chronic prostatitis, pyruia, bacteruria, %sepsis. 
- investigations
    + elevated inflammatory markers
- diagnosis
    + differentials
        * UTI
- clinical
    + presentation
        * much more severe than chronic
        * generalised: spiking fever, acutely ill, malaise, myalgia, dysuria, irritative urinary sx, cloudy urine, tip of penis pain. s
        * voiding symptoms @acutely swollen prostate
        * %%flu like illness.
    + examination
        * @DRE the prostate is exquisitely tender



# Chronic bacterial prostatitis
- basics   
    + chronic urogenital symptoms in setting of bacterial infection of prostate. 
- medical
    + may be refractory to Abx treatment, in which case treat with an additional course of Abx
- mx    
    + same as acute prostatits, bacterial entry of prostate through the urethra ++@transmitted sexually. 
    + especially after short/ sub optimal treatment for acute prostatitis
    + etiology
        * ++E coli (75-80%)
        * %Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus
- clinical
    + rf
        * risk sexual behaviour
        * previous STI
        * suboptimal treatment of previous STI
        * young-middle aged men.
        * diabetes, smoking
        * previous manipulation of the urinary tract
        * prostate stones
    + presentation
        * present with sx of recurrent UTI (frequency, irritation) > 3 months
        * perineal discomfort
        * %low grade fever
        * DRE may reveal a tender prostate
- investigations
    + urinalysis + MCS
        * isolate organism from urine to make diagnosis
        * do not isolate prostate secretions, instead make a presumptive diagnosis with the history.
    + PSA
        * only elevated in 25%, mild elevations.
- treatment
    + require long term (>6 weeks) treatment with Abx with good penetration to prostate.
    + low pH of prostatic secretions and poor penetration of most Abx restricts choice of Abx
    + Abx can use:
        * Fluoroquinolone
        * Bactrim (trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole)
        * Macrolides
        * Tetracyclines 
    + esp fluoroquinole becomes concentrated in the prostate due to pH
    + otherwise guided by MCI testing (eg doxycycline or fosfomycin for resistant Enterobacteriacae)
    + nitrofurantion not used @poor penetration

###### Instability


# Epidemiology
33% chance falling > 65
50% chance falling > 85 
in the next 12 months

# Risk factors
- medications
    + beta bllockers, Ca channel blockers, anticholinergics, BZDs, alpha blckers (first dose hypotension)
- fear of falling/ GAD
- BPSD/ delirium / cognitive impairment
- disability (eg stroke, PD, myopathy)

# Falls history approach

1. usual introduction
2. history of PC (tell me what happened), establish if lost consciousness or not (if syncope == syncope history, not falls). Mechanical vs. dizzines
3. Before: tell me how fell (slip/ trip/ lost balance/ risky behaviours/ was it dark/ basically the circumstances of the fall)
4. D (what did you fall on, what surface did you fall on)
5. A (how did you get up off teh ground, how long were you on teh ground for, rhabdomyolysis). did anyone else ssee the fall
6. any near falls, history of falls

Consequences of falling:
- developing fear of falling == increased risk of falling @change gait to compensate
- what is the impact of having the fall on life (eg fear of going outside)
- impact on mood

Move on to extrinsic/ intrinsic:
('i'm just going to move on to what may have contributed to your fall')
- Extrinsic
    + personal
        * footwear
        * 4WF, walking aids
        * alterred sensation in the feet
    + domestic
        * tripping hazards
        * living arrangement
        * have you ever had an OT assessment before
        * if they have a personal alarm 
    + risky behaviour
- Intrinsic
    + cognitiion (dementia/ delirium)
    + senosry (vision)
    + cardiac (low BP, arrhythia)
    + balance
    + neuro
    + metabolic
    + medications (sedatives/ alcohol) 
        * beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, anticholinergics, BZDs, alcohol
- Behavioural factors
    + interaction between the patient adn the environment
        * eg taking more risky behaviourrs/ wadnering more (could be present @BPSD, delirium, manic episode)

MHx:
- medical condition
- medications, medication changes
- other geriatric syndromes, incontinence

Medications:
- Benzos / sedatives

pADLs/ dADLs/ cADLs
ask about weight loss (in case they are not cooking meals properly.)

How do you intend to plan/ change your behaviour for the future.
Should have something to say about every allied health in general, and then specific scenarois.


OT: assess ability to perform ADLs then do home assessment to assess if they can achieve their ADLs in this environment
Pharmacotherpay: review medicaitons, remove or change time when medications are givne. reduce polypharmacy and get a webster pack.
Nursing staff: wound care, appropriate bedsore managmenet
Physio: functional xercises to strengthen muscle groups
optometrist review: remove bifocal lens (associated with increased risk of falls, hearing aids?)

Prevent:
Falls injuries: hip protector, treat osteoporosis, education on how to get up from teh floor to prevent complciations of a long lie. 

# Physical examinaton
- functional assessment
    + Static stance
    + gait assessment
    + Romberg's 
    + sensory assessment (hearing and vision)
    + time to get up and go (TUG)
    + standing on heels and toes
    + Dix-Hallpike (@vertigo is an issue)
    + functional reach
    + sternal push (someone behind)/ shoulder tug (catch them in front) - paster's test
    + proprioception, sensation and strength
- comorbid disease features
    + AD
        * primitive reflexes
        * cognitive assessmnet (low attention may increase risk of falls)
    + Parkinsons
        * tremor, rigidity, gait, masked facial appearance, reflexes (potentially low @rigidityx)
    + Diabetse
    + CVD/ Respiratory


# Approach to management
- Non pharmacological
    + education about risky behaviours
    + education about how to get up off the floor (reduce risk of rhabdo, pressure sorees, dehydration)
    + PT (build strength, compensatory behaviours, gait aids, reduce pain, increase confidence getting around)
    + OT (provide equipment and giat aids, home assessmeent, rails, beadpan, UI aids, remove hazards, moulded plastic shields to reduce injury if a fall does occur may prevent #NOF)
    + podiatry
        * shoe fitting, treat foot issues like sensation difficulties/ ulcers etc.
    + Social worker
        * drug rehabilitatin, support groups eg Alc or BZD dependent
- Pharmacological
    + reassessment of medications, remove medications lilkely to increase risk/ rationalise or decrease dose etc.
    + may treat anxiety if bellieved it is contributing to falls risk.
    + treatment of nutritional deficiencies
        * eg VitD to reduce damage @fracture and osteoporosis
    + medical treatemnt of drug abuse disorders

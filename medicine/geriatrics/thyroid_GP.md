# Counselling for levothyroxine
Take thyroxine on empty stomach, preferably before bed
Watch out for toxicity side effects, and represent if these emerge -- requires another TSH level
Long release formulations exist (1 week slow release) if compliance is going to be an issue
If hyperthyroidism does occur, then we stop for 1 week and then recommence at a lower dose
Takes 4 weeks to get to steady state level, so wait 4-6 weeks before taking TSH and then correcting the dose.

Mental State examination 
    • Appearance 
        ◦ Apparent age, gender
        ◦ Grooming – hair, beard, make-up, finger nails
        ◦ Clothing – style, colours, cleanliness, odour
        ◦ Distinguishing physical features – scars, tattoos, deformities, teeth
    • Behaviour/ Psychomotor activity
        ◦ Gait on entry, posture on sitting
        ◦ Increased/decreased general activity
        ◦ Extraneous movements, tremors, tics
        ◦ Facial expressions – grimacing, smiling, frowning, poverty, furtive
        ◦ Eye contact – with interviewer, other parts of the room, open/closed, downcast 
    • Speech
        ◦ Largely the motor aspects of speech (form):
            ▪ Volume – loud/soft (dysphonia)
            ▪ Prosody – speech rhythm – monotone, variability
            ▪ “pressure”
            ▪ Dysarthria
        ◦ Language
            ▪ Dysphasia – receptive, expressive
    • Affect & Mood
        ◦ Mood: sustained feeling state, verbatim what the patient reports
        ◦ Affect: observable feeling state of the patient during the interview 
        ◦ Quality 
            ▪ Generate a useful list of observable feeling states
            ▪ Sad, depressed, euphoric, elated, anxious
            ▪ Angry, suspicious, guarded
            ▪ Euthymic
            ▪ Perplexity
                • Bewildered, puzzled
                • Often co-occurs with serious thinking abnormality
                • Think – organic/psychotic 
            ▪ Fatuous
                • Vacant, silly, superficial
                • Often incongruent with thought/situation
                • Think – psychiatric 
        ◦ Intensity (quantity)
            ▪ Mild/moderate/severe
            ▪ Superficial, bland, poverty 
        ◦ Range
            ▪ During interview you will cover a number of emotionally laden topics – observe the affective response
            ▪ Range = diversity of affective states patient can mount
            ▪ “restricted” range refers to limitation in the capacity to engage different affects
            ▪ Commonly reduced in organic, psychotic and affective disorders
        ◦ reactivity
            ▪ dynamic aspects of changes in affect during the interview:
            ▪ lability – rapid changes e.g. sadness  euphoria
            ▪ irritability – refers to rapid escalation into anger, sensitivity
            ▪ “flatness” – refers to restrictions of tone of an affect – often seen in depression
        ◦ “blunting”
            ▪ Often erroneously used interchangeably with “flattening”
            ▪ Loss of sensitivity to the emotional import of event
            ▪ Loss of empathy for an emotional event
            ▪ Differs from flattening – little awareness for the emotionality of an event (cf flattening where there is awareness but little capacity for emotional response)
            ▪ Common in psychiatric states e.g. schizophrenia  
        ◦ Congruence, appropriateness
            ▪ Relationship between the quality/depth of an affect and content of though/situation
            ▪ Normally thoughts and affects congruent e.g. sad thoughts  sad affect
            ▪ Affective disorders associated with congruent affect
            ▪ Incongruence refers to mismatch affect and thought – common in psychotic disorders
            ▪ Sometimes associated with an incapacity to mount an affective response
        ◦ Communication 
            ▪ Mysterious, imprecise observation: empathically experience the feeling state of another:
            ▪ attitude towards the examiner
            ▪ In the presence of a person with:
                • Depression  you feel sad
                • Anxiety  you feel anxious
                • Mania  you feel euphoric 
                • Anger  you feel angry
                • Schizophrenia  commonly feel nothing 
    • Thought
        ◦ The thought process (form) and content (content) of the patient during the interview:
            ▪ Stream – pace of thought generation:
                • Slow – depression, organic states
                • Fast – anxious states
                • “pressured” – manic states
                • Increased latency – slowness to respond to question
            ▪ Form – connectivity of ideas
                • Concerned with logically/understandability of connections between one thought and another
                • Extensive and complex literature in psychiatry 
                • Abnormalities of though form
                    ◦ Accelerated/retarded thought form with normal connections:
                        ▪ “flight of ideas” increased number of ideas, produces at rapid pace (characteristic of mania)
                        ▪ Retardation – relative poverty of ideas produced at slow pace (characteristic of depression, some psychotic disorders)
                        ▪ Circumstantiality – overinclusion of ideas, overly detailed train of thought, in time returns to the point (characteristic of some anxious and obsessional states)
                    ◦ Logical disorders of thought form: connections between thought abnormal:
                        ▪ Loosening of associations/tangentiality – logical connections between thoughts tenuous
                        ▪ Derailment – understandable disconnections between thoughts
                        ▪ Blocking – sudden interruption of thought resulting in loss of thought
                        ▪ Word salad – complete disruption of goal direction thought even within an idea 
                    ◦ Other thought forms:
                        ▪ “wooly”, imprecise, vague thinking
                        ▪ Neologisms – new words
                        ▪ Rhyming speech
                        ▪ Idiosyncratic use of words
                        ▪ Echolalia – repetition of the interviewers words 
            ▪ Content
                • “over-valued ideas” – 
                    ◦ “Comprehensible idea pursued beyond the bounds of reason”
                    ◦ Preoccupies the patient
                    ◦ Often strong emotional investment
                    ◦ Passionately held but amenable to some reason 
                • Delusional thinking
                    ◦ Form:
                        ▪ Fixed, unshakeable beliefs
                        ▪ Absolute conviction
                        ▪ Great personal significance/investment
                        ▪ Regarded as false/inherently unlikely by others
                        ▪ Out of keeping with educational cultural, social background 
                        ▪ Emerge in a pathological manner
                        ▪ Often extend to contaminate broad range of other beliefs about the world 
                        ▪ Evoke persistent idiosyncratic behaviour of potentially damaging nature 
                    ◦ Primary delusions
                        ▪ Arse de-novo
                        ▪ Four common primary delusions:
                            • Sudden, autocthonous delusion
                            • Delusional atmosphere
                            • Delusional perception
                            • Delusional memory
                    ◦ Secondary delusions
                        ▪ Arise understandably from other psychic events/interactions with the world
                        ▪ Maybe traced to primary delusions, affects, drives, fears, hallucinations etc
                        ▪ Maybe amenable to psychological exploration and meaningful understanding
                        ▪ Possibly amenable to psychological transformation  
            ▪ Possession
                • A number of delusions relate to the patients sense of control over their thoughts:
                    ◦ Thought insertion
                    ◦ Thought withdrawal
                    ◦ Thought control by others
                    ◦ Passivity phenomena - related phenomena in which the patients feels influenced by other agencies
                    ◦ Made thoughts, feelings and actions 
            ▪ Obsessional thinking
                • Characteristic of OCD
                • Defined by:
                    ◦ Recurrent, intrusive phenomena
                    ◦ Thoughts, images, impulses
                    ◦ Distressing
                    ◦ Resisted by the patient
                    ◦ Recognised as patients own thought 
                • Obsession-like thinking also seen in psychotic and affective disorders but without al the above features 
    • Perception
        ◦ Sensations:
            ▪ Simple experience of the world as received through impulses from sensory organs
        ◦ Perceptions:	
            ▪ More complete experiences which incorporate sensation and intellectual “knowing”
            ▪ Incorporates ourselves in relation to the object
            ▪ Assimilate meaning into the perception therefore involve thought to some extent 
        ◦ Abnormalities of perception
            ▪ Sensory distortions:
                • Increased/decreased (loud/soft, bright/dull, large/small)
                • Misinterpretation – true perception, misjudgement of the nature of the perception e.g. hear the win whispering your name
            ▪ Illusions:
                • True perception, transformed by a prevailing affect
                • E.g. frightened patient with delirium misperceives the shadows of tree branches as an oncoming attacker 
            ▪ Hallucinations:
                • Perception without an object
                • Experiences as being “from-the-world”, inhabiting external space
                • Qualities and depth of a normal perception
                • Occur alongside normal perceptions
                • Independent of will (cannot by summoned at will)
                • Can occur in any sensory modality
                • Usually confined to one modality 
                • Classification
                    ◦ Auditory 
                        ▪ Familiar/unfamiliar, gender, single/multiple, directional
                        ▪ “first rank” – one thoughts heard out loud, running commentary, discussion in third person
                        ▪ Commanding – patient feels compelled
                    ◦ Visual:
                        ▪ Ill-defined  complex visions, think organic disorders
                    ◦ Others: olfactory, tactile, gustatory 
                • Pseudo hallucinations:
                    ◦ Images rather than perceptions 
                    ◦ Inhabit inner space 
                    ◦ Product of own mind, thought
                    ◦ Not under voluntary control 
                    ◦ Reported in broad variety of psychopathological states
    • Cognition & Consciousness

            ▪ Orientation
            ▪ ST memory
            ▪ Attention
            ▪ Language
            ▪ Some planning
            ▪ Largely devoid of executive function tests
            ▪ Designed to screen for AD
    • Insight/ Judgement/ Reliability
        ◦ Do they think they are ill?
        ◦ Do they know in what way they are ill?
        ◦ Do they know how they became ill?
        ◦ What do the think they should do about their illness?

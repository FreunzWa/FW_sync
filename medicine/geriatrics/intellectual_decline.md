###### Intellectual decline
- cognition: latin: 'to be acquainted with'

# Dementia - broad
- epidemiology
    + 1% of 60-65s
    + 20-25% of 85+
- medical
    + mx
        * BPSD @cognitive dysfunction == behavioural issues like depression /agitation. Nt dysfunction == hallucaintions /
    + prognosis
        * BPSD resolve somewhat overtime 
        * cognitive dysfunction 
            - retrogenesis (loss of cog abilities opposite order to gained @childhood)
- clinical (varies considerably @type of dementia)
    + features
        * cognitive dysfunction
            - VS, praxis, lanaugge, arithmetic, planning and organisation (exec), memory, attention, arousal
        * 90%BPSD (the non cognitive symptoms of disturbed perception, thought content, mood/ behaviour occuring @dementia)
            - 75%agitation
                + repetive actions, fidgeting, dressing/ underessing, sleep distrubance, pacing
            - 60%wandering
            - 50%depression/ apathy
                + withdrawn/ amotivation
                + sad/ tearful/ hopless/ guilt/ anxiety/ -=esteem/ suicidality
            - 30%psychosis
                + misidentification
                + halluc/ delusions
            - 25%screaming
            - 20%aggression
            - 10%sexual disinhibiton
        * decline in independence (-=driving and ADLs)


# Cognitive assessment
- Cognitive tests:
    + MINI-COG
        * procedure
            - 1. remember 3 words
            - 2. draw a clock
            - 3. recall the 3 words (with cues @needed)
    + s-MMSE (standardized version == elimiates confusion with scoring)
        * areas tested
            - visuospatial
            - praxis
            - language
            - memory
            - arithmetic
            - attention
        * weaknesses
            - importantly does not test frontal lobe functions - executive, so use another test to eval this (often just tack on a CDT), or can do MOCA
            - best for Anglo-Americs with ESB
            - 
        * cutoffs
            - 27 or less: impairment
            - 24 or less: definite abnormal
            - however may miss  mild impairment @ceiling effect
        * factor influencing performance
            - NESB, sensory impairment, medical condition, psych illness like depression in the way, cooperation issues, -=education: should qualify the score with theese factors
    + MOCA (Montreal)
        * max score 30
        * more difficult than SMMSE == ceiling effect is reduced so can better detect mild impairmeent
        * translated into languages
        * exec function testing
    + RUDAS
        * cultural/ethnicically sensisitve
        * minimises effects of cultural learning an lang diversity
    + Clock drawing (clock drawing test - CDT)
        * often good to do if not enough time for an MMSE
        * areas tested  
            - VS
            - long term memory
            - executive function (organisation and planning, both frontal functions)
- patient factors to consider that could be confounding
    + education/ IQ, culture, normal agingprocess, cooperation, cut off scores, distraction/ anxiety around getting assessed

# BPSD assessment and RX    
- CMAI (cohen mansfield agitation inventory) -- assesses assoc 29 behaviours
- NPI-NH
- PIECES framework
    + physical issues (drugs, sytmpoms, acute medical isseu)
    + intellectual changese
    + capacities
    + environment
    + social
- Rx
    + non pharmacological
        * A showy doctor cannot provide enough empathy
            - A (approach to comfort pt)
            - schedules
            - demands (reduce demands)
            - communication (simply, clear, 1/ 2 stage commands)
            - Personal care  (max mobility, hydration, nutrition adn cleaning)
            - Activie and environmeent 
    + pharmacologiacl (consider @risk to others/ and has not repesonded to non pharmacological)
        * some feeatures uinreponseive eto medications (but depreession/ psychotic may be more responsive)

# Differentials for CI
    Normal aging
    MCI
    Psychotic
        Schizophrenia/ Graduate SCZ/ LO SCZ
    Brain tumor
    CVA
    Medications (anticholinergic, sedatives, mood stabiilisers)
    Delirium
    OSA
    NPH
    Post surgery
    Dementias   

# Graduate schizophrenia
- produce cognitive issues with exec function, memmory attention etc.

# Normal aging
- not being able to remember details of event that took place 1 year agbo, or not being able to remember name/ face fo acquantaince
- forgetting things occasionally, word findidng difficulties
- the person may bemore worried abt memory than others

# MCI
- CI more than would be accounted for @aging. difficult to disintguish @times, look at the degree of dysfunction that it causes, as normal aging unlikely to impact too much
- ++risk @progress to AD

# Depressive pseudodementia
- @depression// llow self esteem belieevese getting stupid and AD
- always quick to give up, 'i dont know responses', apathy, aware of cog issues (whereas dementia usu have anosagnosia). forgetful and poor attention

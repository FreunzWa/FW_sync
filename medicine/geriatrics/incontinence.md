###### Urinary Incontinence (UI)
---------------------------------------

define: 'any involuntary loss of urine'
very under-reported by patients @stigma

---------------------------------------

# Approach 
*Organic*
- anatomical approach (organic incontinence)
    + bladder
        * overactive detrusor (urgency incontinence)
        * underactive detrusor (overflow incontinence)
    + bladder outlet
        * outlet laxity (stress incontinence)
        * outlet resistance (overflow incontinence)
        * new outlet (continuous incontinence)
*Inorganic*
- practical causes of incontinence (non-organic)
    + immobility (functional incontinence)

# Classification
- 'urge' incontinence
    + DOA (detrusor over-activity)
        * medications (cholinergics)
        * irritation of trigone (UTI, calculi, malignancy)
- 'stress' incontinence
    + @weakness of the pelvic floor eg @vaginal tear
- 'overflow' incontinence
    + DUA (detrusor under-activity)
        * medications (anti-cholinergics)
    + urinary obstruction
        * eg @BPH/ malignancy/ severe constipation
- 'continuous' incontinence
    + due to fistula or ectopic ureter
- 'functional' incontinence
    + due to impaired cognition, poor mobility, delirium

# Medical aspects
- complications: 
    + independent risk factor for falls @rushing to bathroom/ getting up at night
- 

-----------------------------------------------------------

###### Approach to undifferentiated patient with UI
# History
- cardinals
    + storage
        * frequency, urgency, nocturia, sensation of needing to go
    + voiding
        * weak stream, incomplete emptying, strain 
- Phx
    + obstectrics history (how many children, C-section or vaginaldelivery w/ tears)
    + surgical history (esp any pelvic surgeries)
    + psych history (anyone noticed problems with memory, mood been lately)
- Impact
    + medical
        * cellulitis, pressure ulcers, UTIs, falls, sleep deprivation
    + psyche
        * depression, loss of self esteem, anxiety, social anxiety
    + social
        * impaired relationships
    + sexual    
        * loss of sexual confidence
    + financial
        * individual (continence products + treatment), community (loss of workforce productivity)

# Examination
- abdominal: 
    + bladder (percuss the bladder)
    + masses (faecal mass)
- UG: 
    + women
        * pelvic floor (look for signs of prolapse)
        * atrophic vaginitis (estrogen deficiency in post menopausal women)
    + cough test (look for urinar yless, which might suggest stress incontinence)
- DRE:  
    + prostate/ faecal impaction
- neurological:
    + cognitive function (MMSE)
    + cauda equina syndrome (saddle anaesthesia, loss of sphincteric tone)
- Cardiovascular:
    + postural drop
    + peripheral edema 

# Investigations
- urinalysis, urine MCS
- 48 hour frequency urine chart  
- post void residual volume (catheter)
- urodynamics (flow rate studies)
    + PVR
- urinary tract ultrasound (check for urinary retention w/ features of PVR high, renal damge)
- bloods
    + PSA
    + HbA1c/ fasting glucose level
    + UEC
- CT-IVP (use for suspect ectopic ureter)

# Management
- general measures (1st line)
    + toilet posture, modification of medications, treat faecal impaction, UTI, treat diabetes/ electrolyte disturbance, optimise toilet access, appropriate fluids/ diet, minimise active risk factors, continence products
- specific advice
    + urge incontinence
        * treat underlying cause (for example infection)
        * pelvic floor exercises may help
        * 
    
- specific advice
    + treat underlying cause 
    + UTI
    + constipation (adjust fibre + aperients)
    + topical estrogen creams for atrophic vaginitis
    + BPH (alpha blockers, 5a reductase inhibitors, TURP)
    + urethral stricture (urehtral dilatation, urethrotomy)
    + refractory cases of detrusor (anticholingergics such as doxy-butine, or to theatre for botox injection)
    + stress incontinence (bulking agents, sphincteric reconstruction)
    + detrusor underactivity (catheter)
    + pelvic floor exercises to strengthen teh pelvic floor, use a continence cream (estrogen or something)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### Exacerbants of UI
# Co-morbid conditions contributing to UI
- diabetes (polyuria)
- arthritis/ degenerative joint diseaes (immobility == function/ urgency UI)
- respiratory disease (COPD/ OSA), cough/ snoring worsen stress UI @++abdominal pressure
- CHF/ diuretics (worsen night time urination)
- faecal incontinence
- stroke (impaired immobility, or cause urgency UI)
- parkinsons (can cause urgency UI)
- normal pressure hydrocephalus (causing functional UI and DOA)
- functional decline
- environmental factors (inaccessibility of toilets)

# Medications which contribute to UI
- ACEi (cough exacerbates stress UI)
- anticholinergics (cause urinary retention, but fix DOA)
- Cholinesterase inhibitors (++DOA == urge)
- diuretics (polyuria)
- lithium (diabetes insipidus == polyuria)
- opioids (cause confusion/ constipation)
- Ca2+ channel blockers (urinary retention)
- alpha adrenergics (increase urethral muscle tone == bladder outlet obstruction)
- alpha antagonists (decrease urethral muscle tone == stress UI in women)
- antipychotics, SSRIs
- NSAIDs (worsening nocturia)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### Treatment options
1st line (General measures/ behavioural therapy)
- Bladder training/ Pelvic floor exercises (require good cognition level)
    + bladder training (deferment techniques, progressively hold for longer, may dampen DOA)
    + pelvic floor (esp @hx of pelvic wall tears/ men with soon to have TURP /post TURP)
    + effective in stress/ urgency/ mixed UI

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### UI types

# 'Urge' incontinence/ OAB syndrome
+ basics
    * w/ sensation of needing to void immediately preceding or accompanying an involuntary loss of urine
+ clinical
    * rf
        - more common @older women
    * presentation:
        - sudden need to go to the toilet, %irritation, dysuria, nocturia common
+ medical
    * etiologies 
        - DOA (detrusor over-activity)/ OAB
            + idiopathic is most common (increases with age)
            + irritation (UTI, malingnancy, calculi)
            + cholinergics (eg. donepezil, a relatively common medication used in this age group)
            + neurogenic bladder (eg @stroke, parkinsons, MS)
        - other
            + may develop 2nd to stress incontinence @unpleasant sensation of urine through urethra (in this case is mixed incontinence)
            + %urethral atrophy causing irritation urethritis
+ treat
    * non pharmacological: 
        - continence aids, pads, pelvic floor exercises usu recommended @ may decrease hyperreactivity, decreased caffeine consumption, weight loss, -=alcohol consumption, bladder training
        - OT referral for in-home bathroom assessment, eg hand rails.
    * pharmacological:
        - treat vaginal atrophy @estrogen local (or trials)
        - anti-cholinergics
            + works by causing detrusor relaxation
            + eg (oxybutynin, darifenacin, fesoterodine, solifenacin, tolterodine, trospium)
            + start with low dose, and titrate up monitoring side effects. 
            + side effects
                * anti-SLUDGE side effects
                * urinary retention (excessive blockade)
            + monitorgin
                * to PVR (monitor risk for retention), >1/3 residual is abnormal
        - beta-3-adrenergic agonists
            + works by stimulating detrusor relaxation
            + eg. mirabegron
            + often added @insufficient repsonse to anti-muscarinics or cannot tolerate
            + watch for retention with PVR monitoring
            + considerations
                * monitor blood pressure (@will increase BP)
    * 3rd line
        - Botox injections (@do not tolerate medications). avoid @recurrent UTIs or women with history of retention
        - percutaneous tibial nerve stmiulation (PTNS), once a week for 12 weeks
        - sacral neuromodulation (wire in the S3 foramen)
        - surgical: suprapubic catheter, augmentation cystoplasty

# Stress incontinence
+ invol leakage of urine @increases with intra-abdominal pressure. 
+ ++@female, peak incidence 45-49. the most common type @younger women esp @vaginal tears.
+ presentation: 
    * loss of urine @certain movements/ coughing/ valsalva/ sneeze. usu not nocturia. 
+ etiologies
    * detrusor urethral dyssenergia (@spinal cord damage or disorders)
    * urethral hypermobility @weakened pelvic floor == urethral sphincter fails to close against ant. vaginal wall == @increase with intra-abdominal pressure, urine loss.
        - ++@vaginal birth history == trauma to the pelvic floor
        - %chronic cough, high impact activity, obesity 
    * intrinsic sphincter deficiency: loss of intrinsic urethral mucosal and muscular tone normally keeping the urethra closed. usu @neuromuscular damage/ past pelvic surgeries
+ treat
    * 1st line:
        - Kegel's pelvic floor exercises work best for stress incontinence, pads and other continence products

# Overflow incontinence (Urinary retention)
+ intermittent leakage of urine w/ incomplete bladder emptying. weak stream, hesitancy, nocturia, frequency
+ acute (painful), chronic (painfree)
+ etiologies (2 primary)
    * detrusor underactivity
        - age, occurs 5-10% in older adults severely.
        - peripheral neuropathy (eg @diabetes, vitB12 def, alcoholism)
        - fibrosis of the detrusor
        - neurogenic bladder
    * outflow obstruction
        - external compression of urethra (eg malingnacy, prostate mass)
        - prolapse of pelvic structures
        - urethral stricture
        - severe constipation (esp @opioidds/ post-operative)
        - uterine incarceration of retroverted uterus
        - urethral atrophy @narrows/ less compliant == -=obstruction
+ investigate
    * PVR (through catheterisation), usu elevated.
+ treat
    * no fluids before bed @nocturia
    * men: alpha-blockers trial
    * TURP
    * catheter drainagez
+ complications
    * delirium (esp postoperative)
    * ++UTI risk



### Combination incontinence syndromes

# Mixed incontinence
- mixed incontinence (stress and urgency may both be present). two subtypes: urgency predominant and stress predominant.

# Detrusor hyperreflexia with impaired contractility
- basics
    + @hypersensitive detrusor, with -=contractile capacity due to intrinsic weakness (eg @nervous issue/ wall weakness/ scarred)
    + afferent functional, efferent arc dysfunctional

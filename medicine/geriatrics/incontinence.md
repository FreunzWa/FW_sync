###### Urinary Incontinence

involuntarily passing urine

types:
- storage
    + urge incontinence (tank issue)
        * detrusor overactivity/ scarring/ nervous issue (decreased )
    + stress incontinence (tap issue)
        * reduced sphincter function (eg nervous, physical issue)
- voiding
    + overflow incontinence (causing reflux or comes out the urethra)
    + detrusor underactivity (chronic overfilling, %temporarily after pelvic surgery @handling, diabetes)

look up functional/ psychogenic

# History
- presentation
    + storage
        * frequency, urgency, nocturia, sensation of needing to go
    + voiding
        * weak stream, incompolete emptying, strain
- then specific questions for each area.
- etiology (DIAPERS)
    + delirium () 
    + infection (urge incontinence)
    + atrophic urethritis/ vaginitis (post menopausal women)
    + psyche disorder/ pharmaceuticals (laxatives, anticholingergics, antidepressants - Diabetes insipidus)
    + excess urine output
    + restricted mobility
    + stool retention/ stones  
- bulge in the pelvic floor?
- tumor/ calculi (urge incontinence)
- past history of urinary incontinence
- standard past medical history
- obstectrics history (how many children, C-section or vaginaldelivery w/ tears)
- psych history (anyone noticed problems with memory, mood been lately)
- impact on life
    + medical
        * cellulitis, pressure ulcers, UTIs, falls, sleep deprivation
    + psyche
        * depression, loss of self esteem, anxiety, social anxiety
    + social
        * impaired relationships
    + sexual    
        * loss of sexual confidence
    + financial
        * individual (continence products + treatment), community (loss of workforce productivity)

# Examination
- abdominal: 
    + bladder (percuss the bladder)
    + masses (faecal mass)
- UG: 
    + pelvic floor (look for signs of prolapse)
    + atrophic vaginitis (estrogen deficiency in post menopausal women)
    + cough test (look for urinar yless, which might suggest stress incontinence)
- DRE:  
    + prostate/ faecal impaction
- neurological:
    + cognitive function (MMSE)
    + cauda equina syndrome (saddle anaesthesia, loss of sphincteric tone)
- Cardiovascular:
    + postural drop
    + peripheral edema 

# Investigations
- urinalysis, urine MCS
- 2 day frequency urine chart  
- post void residual volume (catheter)
- urodynamics (flow rate studies)
- urinary tract ultrasound (check for urinary retention)
- bloods
    + PSA
    + HbA1c/ fasting glucose level
- CT-IVP (use for suspect ectopic ureter)

# Management
- general advice you give everyone
    + educating the patient on toileting posture, modifying any existing medications appropriately, correct any metabolic/ electyrolyte disturbances, approrpiate fluids and diet, active risk factors (constipated), adults diapers, toilet accessibility 
- specific advice
    + treat underlying cause 
    + UTI
    + constipation (adjust fibre + aperients)
    + topical estrogen creams for atrophic vaginitis
    + BPH (alpha blockers, 5a reductase inhibitors, TURP)
    + urethral stricture (urehtral dilatation, urethrotomy)
    + refractory cases of detrusor (anticholingergics such as doxy-butine, or to theatre for botox injection)
    + stress incontinence (bulking agents, sphincteric reconstruction)
    + detrusor underactivity (catheter)
    + pelvic floor exercises to strengthen teh pelvic floor, use a continence cream (estrogen or something)

###### Fecal incontinence (FI)
- involutntary loss of liquid or solid feces
- anal incontinence: involuntary loss of solid or liquid feces or flatus
- very underreported

# Classification
    Urge incontinence (desire to  defecate, but unable to retain stool)
    Passive incontinence (lack of awareness of need to defecate before the incontinent episode)

# Epidemiology
- estimated prevalence of about 5% in 80+ community
- Risk factors:
    + UI
    + Diabetes
    + chronic diarrhoea
    + age
    + hormone therapy in postmenopausal women
    + traumatic childbirth

# Types
    Anal sphincter weakness
        Neurological (diabetes == peripheral neuropathy/ spinal cord injury)
        Infiltrative disorders (systemic sclerosis)
        Anal trauma (post childbirth or previous surgery)
    Decreased rectal sensation
    Decreased rectal compliance
    Overflow
    Functional
    Idiopathic



# Idiopathic
- most common @older/middle aged women
- unknown cause but prob @nerve damage to pelvic floor

# Assessment
- history
    + cardinals
    + type of leakage (liquid, solid, gas)
    + presence of urgency/ nocturnal episodes (esp @diabetes/ scleroderma)
    + associated with: pain, motor, sensory symptoms, UI?, POP?, diarrhoea? 
    + history of: diabtes, pelvic irradiation, prior surgery, neurological hx
    + full obstetric history: were forceps used? no of deliveries, traumatic? perineal laceration? 
    + medications, ever used HRT? s
- examination
    + perianal 
        * inspection
        * anal wink reflex for neurologically intact? 
    + DRE
        * assess tone, patient should squeeze
        * assess for masses, fecal impaction

# Investigations
- stool studies @infectious picture/ diarrhoea/ UC symptoms
- endoscopy: sigmoidoscopy @<40, otherwise >40. 
- defecography @fail to respond to treatment (contrast Xray study)

# Management
- non pharmacological
    + education
    + sanitary pads/ adult diapers
    + avoid foods/ activities that cause ++diarrhoea/ FI
        * keep a symptom and food diarrhoea
    + keep perianal skin clean
        * Zinc oxide barrier 
    + anal plug
        * poorly tolerated
- pharmacological
    + no excellent treatment options -- unless assoc with severe diarrhoea
    + bulking agents to improve consistency @patient has low bolume loose stools
        * CI @patients with reduced rectal compliance/ volume eg @radiation proctitis
    + antidiarrhoeal agents @severe diarrhoea (loperamide)
    + injectable bulking agnets
- interventional
    + biofeedback
        * used @confirmed weakness of the pelvic floor on anorectal manometry
    + anal sphincteroplasty
    + sacral nerve stimulation
    + colostomy
    + dynamic graciloplasty
    + artificial anal sphincter

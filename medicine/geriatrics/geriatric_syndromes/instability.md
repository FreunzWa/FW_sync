###### Instability


# Epidemiology
33% chance falling > 65
50% chance falling > 85 
in the next 12 months

# Risk factors
- medications
    + beta bllockers, Ca channel blockers, anticholinergics, BZDs, alpha blckers (first dose hypotension)
- fear of falling/ GAD
- BPSD/ delirium / cognitive impairment
- disability (eg stroke, PD, myopathy)
- urinary incontinence
- medical conditions like osteoarhtritis, AD, PD, sarcopaenia
- osteoporosis == ++risk of injmuyr/ fcarcture @fall

# Falls history approach
    Before-during-after then outside--->in approach
1. usual introduction
2. history of PC (tell me what happened), establish if lost consciousness or not (if syncope == syncope history, not falls). Mechanical vs. dizzines
3. Before: tell me how fell (slip/ trip/ lost balance/ risky behaviours/ was it dark/ basically the circumstances of the fall), standing lying or sitting when happened, on the toilet/ defecating, coughing, in pain or frightened/ anxious. use of drugs up to this point. prodrome eg palpiations, visual changes
4. D (what did you fall on, what surface did you fall on). especially here asked.  did anyone else ssee the fall
5. A - how did you feel after the fall, how long to recover. how long on the ground for. go to hospital?
6. any near falls, history of falls

Consequences of falling:
- developing fear of falling == increased risk of falling @change gait to compensate
- what is the impact of having the fall on life (eg fear of going outside)
- impact on mood
- institutionalisation/ dependency

# Factors influencing falls
    outside-in model of taking falls history
    extrinsic factors (environemnt and personal factors)
        domestic/ environmental factors
    intrinsic factors like sensation, vision, hearing, balance, strength, other medical conditions and medications here as we transitino to a past medical history
('i'm just going to move on to what may have contributed to your fall')
- Extrinsic
    + personal
        * footwear
        * 4WF, walking aids
        * alterred sensation in the feet
    + domestic
        * tripping hazards
        * living arrangement
        * have you ever had an OT assessment before
        * if they have a personal alarm 
    + risky behaviour
- Intrinsic
    + cognitiion (dementia/ delirium)
    + senosry (vision)
    + cardiac (low BP, arrhythia)
    + balance
    + neuro
    + metabolic
    + medications (sedatives/ alcohol) 
        * beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, anticholinergics, BZDs, alcohol
- Behavioural factors
    + interaction between the patient adn the environment
        * eg taking more risky behaviourrs/ wadnering more (could be present @BPSD, delirium, manic episode)
- social 
    + alcohol/ drug abuse
    + smoking (vascular disease/ IHD/ VTE)
    + diet (eg if they are on fluid or salt restrictions - may cause intravascular depletion == vasovagal episode)

# Syncope
- ddx
    + orthostatic hypotension
        * esp @chronic HTN (-= LV compliance and -=baroreceptor sensitivity, vasodilator drugs, volume depletion eg @acute hemorrhage, sepsis, prolonged immobility)
    + vasovagal (@vagal stimulation @distress/ prolonged standing == hypotension and syncope)
    + situational syncope (eg after coughin, swalllowing, urination, defectaton, fear, pain)
    + carotid sinus syndrome
    + cardiovascular (pump issues eg MI, heart block 2 or 3, AF, SVT, rAF, outflow obstruction eg @aortic 
    stenosis)
        * often rapid recovery
        * sudden, often no prodrome. %palpitations
        * sitting or standing/ %after exercise
    + PE (right heart strain)



MHx:
- esp. CVD (arrhythmias, ischaemic heart disease, aortic stenosis, heart block, vascular disease), Diabetes (vision and peripheral neuropathy, edema, do they take insulin - do they get hypoglycaemic episodes), neurological (PD, stroke, brain tumor, NPH), neuropsych (AD), psych (depression, schizophrenia), UI, faecal incontinence, other vision eg glaucoma/ cataracts, hypothyroidism (causes @proximal myopathy)
- medications
    + antipsychotics (cause postural hypotension)
    + benzodiazepines (slower reflexes/ sedated)
    + calcium channel blockers
    + drugs that cause UI (diuretics, cholinergic)
    + beta blockers (@heart block == dizziness) -- especially non selective like propranolol
    + TCAs
    + Antidepressants (SSRIs esp)
    + anticonvulsants
    + digoxin
    + skeletal muscle relaxants
- other geriatric syndromes, incontinence

pADLs/ dADLs/ cADLs
ask about weight loss (in case they are not cooking meals properly.)


OT: assess ability to perform ADLs then do home assessment to assess if they can achieve their ADLs in this environment
Pharmacotherpay: review medicaitons, remove or change time when medications are givne. reduce polypharmacy and get a webster pack.
Nursing staff: wound care, appropriate bedsore managmenet
Physio: functional xercises to strengthen muscle groups
optometrist review: remove bifocal lens (associated with increased risk of falls, hearing aids?)

Prevent:
Falls injuries: hip protector, treat osteoporosis, education on how to get up from teh floor to prevent complciations of a long lie. 

# Physical examinaton
[TUG; from seated stand up and walk three metres and back to sit down. @>14 seconds considered high risk of falling. allowed to use gait aids] 
[Romberg test; tests vision, proprioception, vestibular system. only 2 needed for balance.]
- general examination/ inspection
    + nutritional deficiency (vitamin B12, anaemia)
    + cachectic
    + how dressed
    + how present / speak (psych)
    + check if they are oriented to person time and place
- Vitals
    + lying and standing BPs
    + regular HR?
    + RR
    + febrile
- functional assessment
    + Static stance (posture and can they balance)
    + gait assessment
    + Romberg's test
    + sensory assessment (hearing and vision)
    + time to get up and go (TUG): 3 metres from sitting and back timed. >14-16 secs high risk
    + standing on heels and toes
    + Dix-Hallpike (@dizziness on history)
    + functional reach
    + sternal push (someone behind)/ shoulder tug (catch them in front) - paster's test
    + proprioception, sensation and strength
- comorbid disease features
    + AD
        * primitive reflexes
        * cognitive assessmnet (low attention may increase risk of falls)
    + Parkinsons
        * tremor, rigidity, gait, masked facial appearance, reflexes (potentially low @rigidity)
    + Diabetes
    + CVD/ Respiratory
        * lying and standing BPs
- Always request a bedside glucose. a urine dipstick may also be appropriate. an ecg may be used @HR abnormality or CVD features on history

# Investigations
- FBE (vitb12, fe anaemia eg @chronic bleed, infection eg @UTI)
- VitB12 test directly
- Vitamin D (common deficiency shown to increase falls risk and also osteoporosis == more damage @fall)
- TFTs (proximal myopathy is a cause of falls)
- UEC - BUN and creatinine (AKI could be a cause/ CRF)
- Glucose  (hypoglycaemia)
- ECG
    + heart block 1,2,3
    + arrhythmia
    + ST elevation
    + axis deviation
    + 
- Troponins @cardiac presentation
- CTPA @PE likely



# Approach to management
    Main structure is to revise supports from an outside to in manner.
        Environment (safety eg home review, location)
        Personal supports (social work)
        Equipment (gait aids, things that they touch and interact with, commode)

        Self (medication, medical conditions, psychiatric conditions - visual assessment etc)
            Drugs
            Diet



- E
    + OT home assessment (dangerous hazards, environment, bathroom accessibility and rails, incontinence aids like bedside commode or urinal)
    + consider nursing home or other residential care -- however this is not suitabile in all cases as it is an unfamiliar environemnt, can cause delirium\
    + good lightining in the house
- P
    + Family involved, someone to care for patient close by
- E
    + OT can provide frame, walking aids walking stick. podiatrist for shoes 
    + alarms: pendant alarm to alert distress to get help - ambulance
- S
    + physiotherapist to help with exercises to increase strength, teach to get off the floor
    + diet: nutritional support with dietitian to address any deficiencies. adequate hydration vital esp @UTI cause.
    + drugs: adddress any polypharmcy/ D-D issues.


- Non pharmacological
    + education about risky behaviours
    + education about how to get up off the floor (reduce risk of rhabdo, pressure sorees, dehydration)
    + PT (build strength, compensatory behaviours, gait aids, reduce pain, increase confidence getting around)
    + OT (provide equipment and giat aids, home assessmeent, rails, beadpan, UI aids, remove hazards, moulded plastic shields to reduce injury if a fall does occur may prevent #NOF)
    + podiatry
        * shoe fitting, treat foot issues like sensation difficulties/ ulcers etc.
    + Social worker
        * drug rehabilitatin, support groups eg Alc or BZD dependent
- Pharmacological
    + reassessment of medications, remove medications lilkely to increase risk/ rationalise or decrease dose etc.
    + may treat anxiety if bellieved it is contributing to falls risk.
    + treatment of nutritional deficiencies
        * eg VitD to reduce damage @fracture and osteoporosis
    + medical treatemnt of drug abuse disorders

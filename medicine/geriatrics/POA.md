###### POA

# Approach to history
- very general start ... "what's been on your mind?" ==> then shut up for the first 2 minutes!
    + then expand on one of the mentioned points
    + this general question can tease out a thought disorder @needs to phrase general thoughts into a responses which requires executive function
    + this also builds rapport as the patient does not feel like they are being interrogated
- move onto the next phase, forecast intent to move into more specific questioning

# Psychogeriatric differences from adult
- diseases different in proportions -- eg cognitive impairmnt a more important differential at this stage
- more medical comorbidities
- psychosocial factors
- similar to adolescent @family/ home life more involved
- hearing difficulties -- prompt if need hearing aids
- may not admit mental illness @feel that htis is a character failing 
- Anxiety:
    + unlikely to develop suddenly in old age, usu has pre-morbid history, often OCD/ GAD etc have been deep seated, but often there is a trigger
    + esp @loss of partner @previously dependent on them @too anxious to do day to day activities 
    + may predict dementia
- Depression
    + grey roots sign in older women (@usu dye hair)
    + usually manifests as lack of self care
- Mania
    + tends to present with irritable rather than elevated mood. 
    + the last peak in onset is around menopause so unlikely will be first presentation. must distinguish from alcoholic withdrawal/ WKE/ hyperactive delirium

# Important differentials
- very late onset schizophreniform disorder (schizophrenia of old age.)
    + onset about 60+
    + often delusions about gases/ or people living in the walls. 
    + 10x more likely to be female
    + treatment still antipsychotics, but very low doses required 
- psychotic dementia    
    + banal delusions
    + %%visual hallucinations (more important in LBD) -- get homonculi hallucations (cats, people, silent) w/o sound. very realistic and vivid. 
        * LBD fairly common, some argue that LBD is more common than VaD ~about 15% and underdiagnosed
        * and commonly associated with amnestic AD dementia.
    + acoustic hallucinations

# Psychogeriatric assessment

# Psychosis
- organic caused - UTI
- schizophrenia (onset 18-25), late onset schizophrenia (less severe version), very schizophreniform like psychosis -- not genetically linked to schizotypal. 60+ first onset psychosis (much more likely to be female, often assoc with hearing defecit).
- PTSD - paranoia/ hypervigilance
- depression
- manic episode
- dementia (AD, LBD, FTD, VaD, PDD) -- psychotic symptoms of dementia 
- hyperactive delirium
- delusional disorder (very common in this age group) -- esp jealousy delusions, treat with Aps
- substance induced psychosis (increasing @BB's), but alcohol most common (4/5 cutoff, however @4/5 cotninue testing)

# Cognitive tesitng
- should do at least MMSE + clock drawing test
- Screening for cognitive test: mini -Cognitive test (remember ball car man), then clock drawing test, then recall items

# To look up
-- Fergoli delusions
-- Quetards -- nihilistic delusions about already beign dead
-- psychotic symptoms of dementia

- principles
    + whenever switching from one opioid to another, decrease the dose. 
    + when converting morphine doses, calculate the daily dose
    + SC opioids are more potent than oral opioids by a factor of 3, thus divide by 3 when converting PO to SC
- multiple of relative potency to morphine
    + hydromorphone (x5-10)
    + oxycodone (x1.5)
    + codeine (1/8)
    + tepentadol (1/3)
    + tramadol (1/5)
    + methadone (requries specialist guidance as methadone conversions are complicated)
    + subcutaneous morphine (x3) {thus divide any oral dose by 3 when converting into subcutaneous}
    + fentanyl (x100)

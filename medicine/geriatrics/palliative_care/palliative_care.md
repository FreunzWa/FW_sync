###### Palliative care

# Terminology & New concepts
- breakthrough pain: occurs when comfort provided by background long release pain management on opioids is exceeded. may be severe but usually in the same location/ mechanism as chronic pain. may occur @stress/ anxiety/ coughing/ other physical exertion. high prevalence in people with cancer/ chemotherapy. 

# Overarching principles
- def: improvies QOL for patients and family who face life eatening illness by providing pain and symptom relief, spiritual and psychological support from point of diagnosis to the end of life and bereavement.
- pall care functions:
    + relief from pain and other distressing sx (nausea, constipation, delirium, agitation, other mental status changes)
    + attempts to make family/ individual comfortable with the dying process
    + neither hastens or postpones death
    + attempts to keep patient functional as close as possible to the point of death
    + attempts to support family through process of dying, includes bereavement counselling
    + spiritual and psychological support

# Cannabis
- has not been shown to reduce pain significantly, or treat any type of cancer
- may relieve some degree of nausea/ vomiting, increase appetite, cachexia

# Route of medication administration
- @terminal patient ++%cannot tolerate oral medications @advanced dysphagia/ nausea etc == requires subcutaneous infusion device like a syringe driver or SC needle. must change doses to reflect the change from PO to SC
- may also %give sublingual medications, esp for fentanyl, lorazepam, olanzapine
# Syringe driver
- subcutaneous device for long term delivery of medication, ++used @palliative care patients. gives an infusion of a drug over hours. requires good subcutaneous tissue for sufficient vascularity to be absorbed adequately.  4
- attaches into an existing subcutaneous needle, and can deliver medication for up to 24 hours (can actually be configured to give medication for up to 72 hours). this is primarily good from the perspective of patients dying at home, allows fewer nurse visits and -=demand on patients carers to give regular injections of medications through SC needle.
- avoids need for oral medications when peoiple have difficulty swallowing. 
- prevents the extremes of serum drug concentrations

# DNR
- important for pall care patients to have DNRs. 
- approach to getting DNR, state to the patient + family that we only offer interventions that are going to benefit the patient. and because of extensive morbidity, quality of life issues, probability of death and further harm even @successful, we cannot offer resuscitation. get DNR.

# Advanced care directives
- 

# VAD
- not going to be assimilated by pall care. physicians / GP etc can do a specialist VAD training course and be eligible to  deliver the drug. 
- a specialist is not oliged to talk about  VAD to a patient, and need not refer them to someone who will. 
- the medications used is only known by the VAD provider, and the medication is oral. the aptient is not obliged to take the lethal drug.


# Terminal delirium (terminal restlnessness)
- present in a significant number of pt, studies have shown from 25-75% of pt experience this phenomenon
- considered a palliative care emergency
- rf
- rx
    + palliative sedation
        * pharmacological sedation (given @any existing SC pump available, best prophylactically)
            - neuroleptics: phenobarbitone
            - benzodiazepines: midazolam

###### The dying process
- terminal phase of illness has associated physical/ emotional suffering as well as symptoms which may be un-relievable
- important to recognise when the dying process has begun, so that treatment can be shifted towards comfort care
- hospice/ palliative care attempts to maximise QOL during the terminal phase of illness @symptomatic distress
- treatment continues after death for the family in the form of spiritual/ psychological/ bereavement support
- aim of pallcare is to increase chance of 'good' death, painless, minismiation of symptoms. 

# place of death
- most people prefer to die at home, and has been shown to correlate with a better quality death in comparison
- more complex symptom relief, and patient agitation may be better controlled in a hospital environment.

# diagnosing dying
- %easy to detemrine, and can prognosticate number of days/ weeks and individual has left to live. @dying of heart failure == slightly more challenging to determine @more variable
- @diagnosed, certainly obtaining a DNR order/ ACDs @applicable should be made.
- family conversations


# DNR
- ideally DNR order obtained before the diagnosis of the beginning of the dying phase. unlikely to benefit, more likely to subject pt to trauma/ further damage. 
- however families may expect this, so important to have conversation.
- earlier the better, many often only given DNR in the last 24 hours.

# Physiological changes
- Weakness/ fatiguee/ functional decline
    + -=tolerance @physical activity/ -=ADLs. loss of inability to independently transfer == bed confinement, suggests entering temrinal phase. (thus requires care in terms of pressure sores, continence aids)
    + -=oral intake. majority of patients usu @appetite loss, loss of motivation, fatigue and dysphagia (may limit medication use)
    + no evidence to support caloric intake in final weeks of life, this may distress family. 
    + rehydration also not necessary @may worsen symptoms of coughing/ dyspnoea, and hydration not shown to ameliorate sx of dehydration. requires mouth care
    + -=blood perfusion peripherally. @-=CO/ depletion of intravascular volume == -=peripheral perfusion. manifests (tachy, hypotension, peripheral cooling, peripheral and central cyanosis)
    + neurological
        * -=cosciousness == coma and death
        * terminal delirium (confusion, restlessness, agitation, day/night reversal).
    + changes in breathing pattern
        * may become slow, irregular, Cheyne-Stokes pattern of respirations, periods of apnoea, -=tidal volume
    + accumulation of upper airway secretions
        * @inability to swallow/ -=gag reflex == mucus accumulation == gurling/ crackiling/ rattling sounds with each breath "the death rattle"
    + loss of sphincter control
    + inability to close eyes (@loss of fat in the retroorbital fat pad @cachexia)

# Terminal agitation (restlnessness)
- mental status changes and agitation, may manifest with groans/ moaning == could be misintepreted by the family as physical pain. an emergency @considered a bad death with poor pain control.
- improtant to destinguish from delirium as the treatment protocol is distinct
- rf
    + male gender, younger, ex-smoker.
- triggers
    + entering the terminal phase of an illness
    + certain medications (opioids, benzos, SSRIs, alcohol)


# Confirmation of death
- confirmation of Excpected death
    + ensure patient is DNR, that the death was expected from a known disease process
    + introduce self to family, state intention, express commiserations
    + no palpable carotid pulse (after ~10 seconds of feeling)
    + no heart or breath sounds for ~30 seconds (can go up to 2 minutes)
    + fixed dilated pupils
    + DO NOT do sternal rub, talk to patient, this is for unexpected death.
- unexpected death
    + check for response
    + breathing? 
    + carotid pulse?
    + sternal rub?
    + commence CPR unless DNR

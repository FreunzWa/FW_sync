###### Assessing language

Many aphasic syndromes that at times overlap, and may be associated with generalised cognitive decline, or psychiatric illness.

# Protocol
- introduce, patient impression and orientation
    + inspection: especially look for hemiplegia/ facial droop or other neurological abn
- ask patient's first language, any hearing difficulties? 
- allow patient to communicate freely 
    + how are you today? how did you get in today?
    + (ask about the HOPC to the patient first, then get collateral if needed)
    + impressions: is speech restricted in any way? look for paraphasic errors, loss of verbal comprehension, latency, decreased fluency, echolalia, speech content, anomic aphasia, meaningless word salad, scanning speech. 
    + ?Features of receptive aphasia: (neologisms, paraphasic errors, anosagnosia, reading/writing comprehension affected, fluency maintained, nonsensical, word salad, inflection maintained)
    + ?Features of expressive aphasia: non fluent, anomic features, %mispronunciation, comprehension intact.
- Assess articulation   
    + ask patient to repeat following (CN lesions, muscle weakness etc)
        * 'mmm': CN7, assess lip strength
        * 'kkk': CN9/10, testing oropharyngeal muscles
        * 'lalala': assessing tongue strength CN12
    + cerebellar lesions    
        * ask patient to repeat: British constitution, Baby hippopotamus, Red lorry yellow lorry (looking for scanning speech, ?ability to string syllables together, a cerebellar functionm)
- Assess repetition

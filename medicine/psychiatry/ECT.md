###### ECT
- now use modified ECT since 1950s, which sees use of muscle relaxanat and GA
- originally used by Ugo Cerletti in 1938, awarded nobel prize. invented @observed @patients in post ictal periods had marked resolution of depression. tried @first to use chemical induced by terrible side effects/ toxicity and inconsistent dosage requirements. unmodified ECT main side effect %long bone dislocation @severe seizure
- usually given by a psych that specialises in ECT @increasingly complex
- facile theory of mechanism: 'resets' the brain's circuits so if there is overactivity (eg in mania/ hyperactive delirium/ positive psychotic features) OR underactivity (features of catatonia, affect depression, or other negative psychotic features) these are corrected to normal

### Theory

# Electrical aspects of ECT
- seizure threshold:
    + the minimum electric stimulus required to produce bilateral grand mal seizure for a given electrode placement
    + measured in mC (milli Coulombs)
        * typically 75 for unilateral
        * 100 for bitemporal 
    + the threshold varies greatly @individual (usually 3-5 fold difference) and what drugs are taken, so must do titration session first. 
    + this increases during course of treatment, more rapidly for bitemporal placement
    + the seizure threshold does not necessarily correlate with anti-depressant efficacy @depending on the electrode placement supratreeshold doses are different.
- stimulus dose titration   
    + start wiht subthreshold doses of stimulus and increase gradually
    + males have >%50 higher seizure thresholds due to thicker skulls and larger neural mass == lower current density
- seizure duration
    + point immediately post stimulus until post ictal suppression as determined @EEG. typically consider minimum 15-20 seconds for good results.

# Electrode Placements
- choosing an electrode placement
    + most effective form varies @individual, and there are other considerations
    + there is a move towards unilateral @less side effects (cognitive)
    + other electrode placements are being investigated for use (eg bifrontal)
- bilateral ECT
    + more severe adversee cognitive defecits thereafter (confusion, memory impairment, disorientation)
    + usu requires about *1.5x* seizure treshold. 
    + usu bifrontotemporal placement
- unilateral ECT
    + advantageous @less cognitive side effects
    + however onlyt approaches efficacy of bilateral ECT at very high levels above seizure threshold (*2.5x-6x* -- usu 3x), so the currents required are higher (despite the seizure threshold actually being less than bilateral)\
    + the electrodee is always placed on the right side @less memory and languager impairments
    
# Physiology of ECT
- electrical stimulus through scalp/ skull to brain == depolarises neurons to cause gran mal seizure (similar to spontaneous seizure). 
- with different lead placements different areas of the brain are activated first (lateral == cortical activation first, bilateral == primary diencephalon activation)
- activation of vagal == bradycardia, however there is also a coincident sympatheitc repsonse
- hypertension
- transient adrenocortical simtulation
- mild thyroid stimulation (hyperthrydoisim may result in thyroid storm in rare cases)
-----------------------------------------------------

# EEG
- EEG frequencies in bands:
    + delta waves (1-4 Hz) slow
    + theta waves (4-8 Hz)
    + alpha waves (8-12 Hz)
    + beta waves (13-20 Hz) fast
- normal wave pattern
    + normally brain is in alpha state with eyes closed with minimal stimulation, and beta state with eyes opened in a more aroused state. 
    + when drowsy enters theta
    + asymmetry is present to some degree in 20% of normal EEGs
- phases of ECT/ EEG
    + pre-seizure phase
        * pre-stimulation
            - alpha/ beta wave activity corresponding to the anaesthetised patient
        * stimulation
            - artefact of electrode stimulation, sudden high wave
            - isoelectric phase variable length usu 1-5 seconds (the higher stimulus above threshold == shorter the recruiting phase)
    + 4 seizure phase:
        * recruiting phase
            - virtually indistinguishable from pre-stimulation waveforms w/ beta and alpha activity, but becomes more synchronous
        * tonic phase "stiffening"
            - lasts few seconds, high, slow wave forms increasing. lasts few seconds. delta/ theta waves
        * clonic phase "jerking"
            - usu lasts >10 seconds depending on stimulus. generally considered at least 15-20 seconds produces better outcomes. up to 120 possible, but should abort @here. delta/ theta waves
        * postictal suppression
            - the high amplitude slower waves flatten out approach flatter/ higher frequency than in pre-seizure phase.
    + post-seizure phase
        * flatter/ high frequency phase. usu flatter than pre-seizure phase

---------------------------------------------------

### Administration of ECT

# ECT course
- continuation ECT
    + a brief extension of ECT, done once per week or once per month
    + start ECT when there is any sign of relapse of symptoms occurring may improve LT outcomes
    + may be done if there is a history of early relapse after ECT
- maintenance eECT
    + useful in pt who have high risk of relapse
    + it is a longer sequuence of treatments (weekly/ monthly treatments) usually continue until patient has 1 year of good health

# Procedure of ECT 

# Anaesthesia in ECT
- NPO from midnight until morning treatment/ or >6 hours before treatment
- Induction with propofol (%thiopentone used). should use same agent each time @change stimulus threshold
- muscle relaxant usu with short acting suxamethonium (increased dose @elderly)
- other medications: atropine/ other anticholinergics should be available @risk of severe bradycardia
- bite lock (@facial muscles/ masseter is not blocked by muscle relaxants)
- termination of ECT %required @prolonged seizure duration pharmacologically with either propofol (preferred) or benzos (however cause higher levels of sedation post emergence)

----------------------------------------------------
### Clinical aspects of ECT
- limited application to very important diseases, limited efficacy unless assoc with:
    + Major depression (unipolar/ bipolar)
    + Mania
    + Schizophrenia
    + Schizoaffective disorder
- is used often as a primary treatment or after other treatments have failed
- clinical indicators
    + depressive features: actively suicidal, depressed mothere (concerns about baby development), pregnancy depression, delusional depression, catatonia, refuse to eat, 
    + schizophrenia
    + severe mania including in BPAD and manic delirium
- other potential clinical unles
    + OCD: used if it is uknown if delusions/ psychotic features are present. OCD itself will NOT respond to ECT unless in part is due to psychosis. 
    + Catatonia 2nd to medical condition: often responds, but need to treat underlying
    + PD: shows some benefit for PD for limited period of time post seizure @dopaminergic effect
    + NMS: may have a place in treating unremitting NMS
    + Intractable seizure disorder: marked anticonvulsant properties

# Use of ECT in illnesses
- MDD
    + response rate 80-90% in depression, esp delusional depression and elderly depression
- Mania
    + usu usedd when rapid response required, shows good efficacy in mania/ mixed affective disorders
    + manic delirium patients repond VERY well
- Schizophrenia
    + usu considered today in patients that are intolerant or refractory to drugs. positive symptoms may respond
    + esp useful when features of catatonia/ affective synmptoms
    + those with unremitting treatemnt resistant chronic schizophrenia are leess likely to respond, but may improve outcomes esp with medication also used

# Patient age
- older patients may actually respond better, especially because feature sof psychomotor retardation, refusal to eat and catatonia are more common features
    + however @aged brains are old and slow, higher seizure treshold/ shorter seizures and may require longer courses
    + important to treat intercurrent illnesses
    + cognitive sisde effects may be more pronounced
- adolescent patients respond as well, but antipsychaitric movemetns have seen limited use of ECT in some states @fear of developmental damage (but surely the develpomental cost of severe depression must be FAR WORSE!!!)

# Anaesthetic assessment and considerations during ECT
- Absolute contraindications
    + Increased intracranial pressure (high risk of +=ICP == death)
- High risk situations
    + recent AMI (<10 days)
    + intracranial masses (weigh benefits and risks, if there is no ICP then should be fine)
    + known AVMs/ aneurysms (due to risk of post treatment hypertension)
- CVD
    + Transient bradycardia (care in bradcardia pt)
    + Transient hypertension (esp @pre-ictal anxiety)
    + AMI (usu CI @<10 days since infarction, but up to 3-6 months there is still risk) 
    + Cardiac pacemaker (must know if this is present so can take preacuations)
- Endocrine
    + Addisons disease/ corticosteroid dependence
        * may require higher doses
- Diabetes
    + close monitoring of BSLs, measure 1 hour prior. risk of hypoglycaemia esp @fasting
- Phaeo
    + pt with phaeo @high risk of crisis, so must alpha/beta blockade prior
- Dehydration
    + esp @not drinking fluids, increased risk of clotting
- Increased intracranial pressure / intracranial masses
    + can cause severe deterioration
- Ocular
    + open angle glaucoma (cuases increased intraocular pressure)\
- Osteoporosis
    + ensure full muscle relaxation during seizure
- Respiratory disorders
    + smoker: discourage smoking morning of ECT
    + COPD/ asthma treatment to be given before
- Teeth
    + should be assessed for loose teeth, @may not last 
- urine retention
    + %%%bladder rupture, so catheterise


# Side effects
- common/ less serious
    + cognitive
        * temporary (resolves < few hours): memory loss, sedation, confusion, immediate difficulty learning
            - anterograde memory dysfunction usu universal but improves rapidly
            - retrograde memory loss also common, takes longer to improve, but usually limited to events prior to ECT %%permanent autobiographical memory loss
    + cardiac
        * mild arrhytmias benign, hypertension (% use vasodilators/ beta blockers)
- serious
    + orthopaedic complications @insufficient relaxant
    + dentition damage @insufficient relaxant
- mortality risk
    + 1 per 10,000-80,000 patients

# Drugs and ECT
- what drugs should/ can be used alongside ECT
    + antidepressnat
        * usu use after ECT to maintain improvement, the drug should be one that the patient is not resistant to.
        * moclobemide fine
        * MAOis: can potentially worsen autonomic dysregulation
        * TCAs should not be used @QTc prolongation and alpha blockade
    + benzos
        * are anticonvulsnat== requires higher stimulus and ECT is less effective @impairs the propagation
    + lithium
        * lithium toxicity has lower threshold thought @disrupt BBB during ECT and rapid influx of Li into neurons
        * still used with ECT but should stop @individuals with severe post ECT confusion
    + antipsychotics
        * safe, should be used for sedation instead of benzos

# Post ECT management
- high rate of relapse after eCT esp in the firs tmonth so treatemnt is required post ECT
    + medications
        * start antidepressants close to the end of the treatment course, choose one which not prefviously shown reisstance to 
    + continuation ECT
    + maintenance ECT

---------------------------------------------
# Patient counselling
+ benefits
    * works for some conditions more effectively and quickly than drugs. does not cure. may helps maintain improvement. for certain conditions, up to 80-90-% of patients do respond
+ risks
    * any medical procedure entails certain degree of risk. however ECT is very safe, no more risky than any other minor surgery undeer GA. 
+ Addressing concerns
    * not painful as you will have GA on board
    * no proof that it causes any brain damage, mild memory loss/ confusion after you wake up but this goes away pretty quickly. 
+ Preparation/ Advice
    * should not eat/ drink 6 hrs before or the morning of
    * wear own clothes, comfortable loose top
    * hair should be washed clean and tidy, but not thick hair conditioners etc
    * nail polish removed, remove jewellery as these can interfere with some of thee monitoring devices
    * do not drive or operate heavy machniery 24 horus after EECT
+ procedure
    * avg number of treatments to treat is about 9, given about 2-3 times per week
    * usually treated as an inpatient esp @acute phase

###### Perinatal health
- most women do not suffer from any psychiatric symptoms, apart from mild anxiety/ stress/ sadness. 
- those women that do expererience psych effects there can be consequences for baby, self, family
- social interactions between infants/ parents (early attachment relationship) have profound influence on mental and emotional development. quality of parental responses repeated over time determines child's expectation of what will provide safety for them. those that suffer traumatising early relationships experience longer term difficulties w/ emotional interaction/ development
    + severe cortical growth stunting (brain volume less, and ventriculomegaly)


   

# Previous severe MH illness
- schiz/ BPAD during pregnancy
- diagnosis of schiz/ BPAD usually predates pregnancy. these disorders may caus issues for planning pregnancy/ relationship with baby/ health of fetus  
- due to illness, the mother may have attentional defecits/ lack of intimacy/ impaired competence in making decisions for the baby
    + with schiz: 
        * pregnancy more commonly unwanted than general pop. 
        * pregnancy more likely to be a complex one @features:
            - poor nutrition, toxic habits
            - poor social support
            - violence victims
            - homelessness/ poverty
        * impact of illness on pregnancy:
            - they present late, have poor self care habits so there is IUGR
            - more likely preterm delivery and birth complications
            - higher rates of C-Section, cannot manage labor
            - there is increse risk of cardiovascular/ congenital abnormality/ stillbirth and failure to thrive
    + with bipolar disorder
        * mania poses severe risks @impulsivity/ poor judgement, esp poor care due to mania
        * difficult to treat @mood stabilisers have a teratogenic effect, and there are risks to infant


# Common mental health problems during and following pregnancy
- depression
    + depressive feelings during pregnancy: common, peak during T3, fall following delivery. 
    + post partum 'blues': time limited mood disturbance in postpartum, very common up to 80%
    + postnatal depression: 50% are new onset cases, the other 50% had depression efore
- anxiety
    + GAD and OCD higher in perinatal population
    + PD and PTSD are no different in prevalence
    + 10%+ have anxiety symptoms but not GAD criteria
    + pregnancy specific anxiety is common (fear of giving birt)
- impact of depression/ anxiety
    + lack of care abt pregnancy, risk of suicide
    + poor health behaviours
    + increased risk of spontaneous abortion
    + poor materal-fetal attachment
    + fetus-arousal
        * heart variability (fetal stress), fetal movement patterns (more movements during REM sleep), greater wakefulness
        * IUGR, ++spontaneous preterm both, neonatal growth retardation
    + longer term:
        * -=IQ in adolescence, impaired language development, increasd rate of ADHD


# Treatment of perinatal health problems
- use of psychotropics
    + rationale is to prevent relapse of BPAD and SP, prevent postnatal depression
    + pscyhotropic medications
        * antipsychotics
            - ++risk of GDM, more likely C-section require
            - 
        * increased risk of pregnancy complications (reproductive loss)

###### Alcohol withdrawal
- @prolonged AUD w/ excessive alcohol consumption == accumulation of alcohol in blood == tolerance and withdrawal symptoms @abrupt cessation.
- mx: @chronic alcohol exposure == neurons become relatively insensitive to GABA activation, thus requires constant presence of alcohol to maintain homeostasis. 

# Alcohol withdrawal clinical presentation
- mild symptoms may still occur whilst there is an elevated BAC
- mild withdrawal symptoms (similar to short term symptoms of thyrotoxicosis)
    + insomnia
    + tremulousness
    + mild anxiety
    + GI upset, anorexia
    + headache
    + diaphoresis
    + palpitations
- moderate-severe features
    + withdrawal seizures
        * withdrawal tonic clonic seizures (usu 12-48 hours after the last alcohol drink). usu @long history of chronic alcoholism.
    + alcoholic hallucinosis
        * hallucinations that develop 12-24 hours of abstiencne, resolve in 24-48 hours. usu visual hallucainations. patients are aware of hallucinations. 
        * not necessarily DT at this stage, and may have normal vital signs. @may occur within 24 hours at this time cannot be DT
    + delirium tremens 

#  Delirium tremens (DT)
+ 5% of pt with withdrawal progress to DT
+ DT: hallucinations, disorientation, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, agitation, diaphoresis. 
+ usu onset 48-96 hours after last drink, may last up to 5 days. 
+ not synonymous with alcoholic hallucinosis
    * alcoholic hallucinosis 
+ ABG shows respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation. 
+ hypovolaemic and hypokalemia
+ hypophosphataemia @malnutrition
+ rf:
    * sustained drinking hx, hx of withdrawal seizures
    * history of DT, age >30
    * longer period since last drink. 
+ medical
    * natural history
        - death in DT can result from arrhythmia due to hyokalemia
    * cx


# Investigations/ Differential diagnosis
- important to rule out differentials eg perform LP/ CT scan (as the presentation may sometimes have fever/ altered mental status)
- also various mimickers can exist with alcoholic withdrawal, as this may have prompted the individual to stop drinking (eg meningitis, pancreatitis, GI bleeding, hepatic fialure)



# Treating alcohol withdrawal
- treat symptoms and correct electrolyte derangements. 
- alcohol withdrawal seizures
    + benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, propofol
    + do not use phenytoin

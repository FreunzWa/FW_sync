# SSRIs
- general:
    + mx
        * selective serotonin reuptake inhibition == ++serotonin in cleft == mood elevation
    + ix
        * Major depression
        * Anxiety syndromes
            - Generalised anxiety disorder
            - Post traumatic disorder
            - Panic disorder
            - Obsessive compulsive disorder (only SSRIs - mild)
            - Social phobia
        * Other
            - Neuropathic pain states (Tricyclics are used here/ %SNRI)
    + ses
        * common: sexual dysfunction,  ND, agitation, insomnia (esp start), dry mouth, tremor, rhinitis, anxiety, myalgia, rash
        * rarer: EPSEs (inc tardive), sedation, confusion, palpitations, hyponatremia/SIADH (starts early, esp @old), platelet dysfunction
        * serious: %%acute-closure glaucoma (esp paroxetine), serotonin syndrome syndrome, hepatic failure, blood dyscrasias, +=suicidal ideation after starting (esp @<25 yrs), PSSD
    + considerations
        * CI @known BPAD @risk of provoking a manic episode, ++risk of upper GI bleed @==worse bleeding. 
        * dd interaction with other serotonininergic drug (esp MAOi) == serotonin syndrome
        * safe to use in pregnancy/ breastfeeding (SSRIs are usually preferred)

Sertraline
- commonly used
- more activating (anxiety)
Escitalopram

- %%QTc prolongation
Paroxetine
- most likely to cause acute closure glaucoma (still v rare)
- most likely to cause withdrawal syndrome @non linear pharmacokinetics
Fluoxetine
- has a long elimination half life (abt 14 days), be careful for serotonin toxicity
- more activating (anxiety)

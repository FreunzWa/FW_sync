###### Antipsychotics
    Typical (first generation) antipsychotics
    Atypical (second generation) antipsychotics
    Partial-agonist antipsychotics
- aka neuroleptics "from the greek to take hold of the nerve"/ major tranquilisers
- effective @treating psychosis int he short term  but @long term significant side effects.

--------------------------------------------------------------

# major indications
- secondary psychotic episode
- schizophrenia
- psychotic depression
- treatment-resistant depresesion
- schizo-affective disorder
- BPAD with psychotic features (in conjunction with mood stabilisers)

# Side effects
- typicals (anti-Dopamine)
    + EPSEs
- atypicals (high affinity for 5-HT and Dopamine receptors)
    + less EPSEs, but much more metabolic side effects (muscarinic off target) -- clozapine/ olanzapine the worst for metabolic
        * the metabolic side effects @++carbohydrate cravings and ++storage of fat
- partial agonists
    + eg aripiprazole/ brexpiprazole. avoid hyperdopaminergic state and avoid total dopamine withdrawal. these drugs will be used more and more @more data @anticipated fewer side effects

# Goals of treatment
- maintenance is vital due to high rate of relapse @withdraw treatment due to lack of compliance. @relapse, 1/6 == treatment resistant group and lose function

# Consequences of treatment
- @long term treatment == hypersensitivity to dopamine == @abrupt cessation == severe psychotic withdrawal episode ('rebound psychosis'). Depo injections are better @longer period of elimination halflife.
- assuming compliance
    + emergence of 2ndary negative symptoms

- if there is a relapse, then more likely to enter the treamtent resistant group of schizophrenia. 


# Treatment algorithm for first episode of psychosis
1. exclude organic cause
2. initial medication free period of at least 48 hours
3. FIRST LINE TREATMENT
- Low dose of atypical antipsychotic
    + Olanzapine, Risperidone, Aripiprazole, Quetiapine, Ziprasidone, Amisulpride
4. Review in 2-4 weeks
- @good response, continue the medication for 12 months, then withdraw gradually after this with careful monitoring (usu about 3-6 months)
- @inadequate reponse, increase dose. continue for at least 3-6 weeks
5. @still inadequate response, alternative atypical and consider augmentation (with Valproate, Lithium) in a schizoaffective presentation. Review in 6-8 weeks.
6. @still inadequate response, then try cloazpine or typical agent

# Treatment allgorithm for relapse schizophrenia
- DEPOT if adherence is a problem
- use a typical antispsychotic only if it has been used in teh past before with good rspones
- otherwise use atypical
- if still resistant, then go cloazpine

# Augmentation treatment
- usu used @clozapine treatment failure, which is rare. 
- combinations of antipsychotics
    + atypical (oral) + typical (depot)
    + clozapine + x antipsychotic
        * clozapine/ +'tight' D2 antagonist (risperidone/ amisulpride/ sulpiride)
        * clozapine/ quetiapine
        * clozapine/ aripiprazole
    + clozapine OR other atypical + moodstabiliser (carbamazepine, valproate, lithium) - esp @affective component. 
    + clozapine + SSRI / mirtazapine (may help with negative psychotic symptoms)

# ECT in treatment resistant schizophrenia
- is sometimes an option

# changing antipsychotics
- often there is motivation to change from tpical to atypical (esp @emergent TD), however increases the risk for rebound psychosis
- issues
    + rebound psychosis
    + rebound insomnia
    + cholinergic rebound
        * esp @switching from agent with high M1 binding to low M1 binding (eg clozapine to risperidone, amisulpride, aripiprazole)

------------------------------------------------------------
# Typical antipsychotics
- 1950s, with chlorpromazine, eventually haloperidol became the benchmark. 
- EPSEs/ akathisia side effects were relatively common, and TD complication due to potentially severe hypodopaminergia
- have off target effects including anticholinergic (dry mouth and constipation), antihistamine (sedating), alpha adrenergic blockade


------------------------------------------------------------

# Atypical antipsychotics
- work with high ratio of 5HT2/ D2 receptor occupancy
- clozapine first atypical, but poorly tolerated due to 1% cause severe blood dyscrasias -- in some considered to be the most efficacious, only used in treatment resistant psychosis -- 30% in this group will respond to clozapine. 
    + agranulocytosis/ cardiomyopathy/ myocarditis/ extremely severe chronic constipation
- very weak D2 blocker, reduces dopamine through 5HT2 occupancy, like most of the atypicals
- only indicated for treatment resistant psychosis (thought to be different mechanistically)
- most of the atypicals are equally effective for positive psychotic symptoms
- mainly the side effects which guide selection of antipsychotic

# Clozapine
- Medicare:
    + requires specialised medical practitioner to prescribe (CAP/ CMPS protocol)
- Effect: 
    + Has some benefit for negative psychotic symptoms, and may alleviate some degree of the cogntive impacts of schizophrenia.
    + @betray clozapine and then relapse, reduced efficacy
- Reactions:
    + common: metabolic (weight gain, cholesterolaemia)+++, anticholingergic+++, QTc prolongation+++, hypotension+, sedation+++
    + severe: potentially fatal (agranulocytosis, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, severe constipation). severe withdrawal reaction @sudden cessation
- Lifestyle
- Tests
    + requires 6 monthly ECG/ TTEs
    + requires weekly FBE for first 18 weeks, tthen once per month after that
        * also, berofre starting the patient must have had an FBE with WBC >3.5 
        * if at any point during treatment symptoms of infection begin (including sore throat/ mouth ulceration) then require immediate blood test and twice weekly tests. 
        * after ceasing treatment, require 1 more FBE 4 weeks after, or if they are still in the weekly treatment phase then 1 every week for 4 weeks 


# Amisulpride
- Effect:
    + Has some benefit for negative psychotic symptoms


------------------------------------------------------------

# Depot antipsychotics
- widely used @issues with adherence,

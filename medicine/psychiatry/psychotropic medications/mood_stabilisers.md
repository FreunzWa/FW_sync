###### Mood stabilisers

# Lithium - prescribing
- dosing
    + start @300mg bd or tds, then increase by increments of 300-600mg every 1-5 days based on response/ tolerability. usu start multi-dose daily @reduce side effects
        * eventually get to 900-1800mg which is usu range in which therapeutic conc occurs
    + half-life 24 hours, thus takes abt 4-5 days to reach new equilibrium conc @change dose.
- levels
    + levels are higher for single dose regimens (eg a once daily dose of Li == 1.0, if divided into 3 == 0.8 levels)
    + levels for acute phase Rx betwee 0.8-1.2 mEq/L. levels should not exceed 1.2
    + levels should be taken 5-7 days after dose changese. 
    + levels should be taken before changing the dose if the last level not taken >2 weeks. 
    + levels should be taken in morning, 12 hours after last dose. (11-13 hrs fine)
    + pt with steady doses should have levels taken every 6-12 months
- factors that affect levels
    + dehydration/ renal impairment == ++Li
    + ++Na intake == ++Li/ Na+ excretion == -=Li
    + -=Na intakee == ++Li reabsorption == ++Li
- managing side effects
- tests before starting
    + UEC, urinalysis, TFTs, calcium, BUN, creatinine
    + pregnancy test for women of childbearing age
    + ECG for pt with CAD risks

# Lithium toxicity
- can cause death @MODS
- clinical diagnosis, confirmed @levels
- many pt unfort suffer an episode of toxicity @narrow TI
- levels:
    + mild: >1.5
    + severe/ emergency: >2.5
- symptoms associated with suprathreshold Li toxicity
    + mild: blurred vision, NVD, weakness, sedation, apathy, ataxia, flu like illness
    + severe: rigidity, hyperreflexia, tremor, dysarthria, disorientation, psychosis, seizures, coma

# Lithium - medical aspects
- contraindications
    + severe renal dysfx
    + sodium depletion
    + dehydration
    + severe CVD (@Li can cause arrhythmias)
    + preg X @cardiac defects
- relative contraindciations
    + psoriasis (exacerbated by Li)
- complications
    + nephrotoxicity
    + %cardiotoxic (arrhythmias, heart blocks)

# Lithium - Side effects ()
- SEs assoc with therapeutic range
    + G: metallic taste, NVD, abdominal pain
    + M: weight gain
    + E: ++Ca+, hyper PTH, subclinical hypothyroidism, %hyperthyroidism
    + D: acne, psoriasis, %hair loss
    + N: vertigo, tremor, headache, fatigue, %nystagmus, %memory impairment/ mild cognitive impairment
    + C: benign T wave changes on ECG, %arrhytmias
- managing side effects important @++compliance
    + tolerance can emerge to sx like NVD, but some not eg weight gain
    + strategies:
        * allow tolerance to take care of minor symptoms
        * can change time/ dose of medication
        * change to slow release/ immediate lithium
        * dividing daily dose into smaller amounts more often
        * treat side effect with drug
        * switch to different mood stabiliser

# Lithium - drug interactions 
- pt with these drugs require closer monitoring
- increases Li
    + thiazides
    + NSAIDs
    + ACEi
    + Tetracyclines and Metronidazole
- decreases Li
    + K+ sparing diuretics
    + theophylline
- %decrease/ increase Li
    + Ca blockers
    + loop diuretics

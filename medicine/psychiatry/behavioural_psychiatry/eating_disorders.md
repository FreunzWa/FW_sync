    + gastroparesis (delayed emptying)
    + FBE: NN anaemia (anaemia of chronic disease @BM suppression), leukopaenia, thrombocytopaenia
    + raised serum carotene
    + CMP: hypophosphateamia, hypokaelamia, dehydration, hypercholesterolaemia, hyponatremia

- treatment
    + MEDICAL admission criteria
        * vitals:

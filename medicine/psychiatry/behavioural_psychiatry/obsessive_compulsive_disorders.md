# OCD
- basics   
    + recurrent intrusive thoughts/ images/ urges == anxiety.
    + the intrusive thoughts are egodystonic (they cause stress)
- epidemiology
    + usu starts @childhood/ adolescent, with a mean age of 19.5. %%begins >35 yrs
    + lifetime prevalence of 2.3% 
    + F>M
- medical
    + associated
        * 3 in 4: anxiety disorder (PD, SAD, GAD, Specific phobia)
        * 63% w/ lifetime hisotry of mood disorder (esp MDD)
        * 23% have comorbid OCPD
        * 29% tic disorder
        * more common: body dysmoprhic disorder, trichotillomania, excoriation
    + rf:
        * pre-morbid BPAD, schizophrenia, eating disorders, tourette's
        * GAS infection can be associated with onset ("pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder assoc @strep infection")
- clinical
    + ddx
        * specific phobia, SAD, hoarding disorder, GAD, MDD, tic disorder
        * obsessive compulsive personality disorder
    + diagnosis
        * @patient has risk factor conditions the patient should be tested for OCD. take full history fo the enature of the compulsions/ delusios, severity will inform treatemnt
        * DSM-5 criteria for OCD
            - (A) presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both:
                + Obsessions
                    * recurrent/ persistent thoughts, urges, images that are experiend that are unwanted causing anxiety
                    * person attepmts to ignore such thought or neutralise them
                + Compulsionsa are defined by
                    * repetitive behaviours or mental acts to avoid some perceived anxiety or negative event
            - (B) O/C are time consuming or cause distress or -=fx
            - (C) the OCD sx are not attributable to organic/ drugs
            - (D) the sx are not better explained @other MH disease
        * complications
            - suicidality
                + very common, up to 46% for suicide attempts. 
            - risk to others
                + research does not suppor the claim that they are a risk to others
        * prognosis
            - remission rates are low, abt 20%.
            - @childhood OCD, 40% remit @adulthood
    + presentation
        * cardinal  
            - ++%gradual onset, %acute (usu @infection)
        * core psych symptoms:
            - obsessions/ compulsions (usually both)
            - obsessions: intrusive repetitive/ persistent thoguhts (images or urges). pt will attempt to suppress these thoughts
            - compulsions ("rituals"): reptitive behaviours (eg washing/ checking/ counting/ praying) to achieve a sense of 'completeness'
        * obsession/ compulsion dimensions
            - cleaning (fear of contamination)
            - symmetry (ordering/ aligning)
            - forbidden/ taboo thoughts (sexual/ religious thoughts)
            - harm (self or others)
        * dysfunctional beliefs are common (inflated responsbility, perfectionism)
        * insight (common that insight is a feature of the condition - to varying levels)
        * menstrual factors == variability of symptoms (hormonal role)
- management
    + consists of serotoninergic antidepressants and CBT
    + pharmacotherapy
        * improves sx in 40-60%, and there is a low rate of relapse for patients that remain on therapy
        * SSRIs
            - better than placebo. all approved except @citalopram/ escitalopram
        * Clomipramine
            - better than placebo, but poorly tolerated in comparson. not superior to SSRI
        * Venlafaxine (S-NRI)
            - use is only weakly supported, more research is required
    + regular review (psych conditions like this require review as they can flare/ regress in response to life conditions)
    + CBT 

    + exclude medical causes
    + examination special consideration 
    + pharmacotherapy (recommended with predominantly depressive disorder, perhaps on the follow up if still concerning)
        * SSRI (or you can use TCA clomipramine)



# Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)
- basics
    + preoccupation with nonexistent/ slight defects in physical appearance. (when in reality they lok normal). 
    + this leads to repetitive predictable behaviour -- these behaviours cause signiffjncant stress
    + BDD is common but underdiagnosed
    + can be associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation
    + usu when patients present it is to get non psych treatment for their perceived abnormalities -- which would be ineffective and risky to provide. 
- diagnosis
    + DSM-5
        * preoccupation with 1+ non existent or slight defect in their physical appearance (thinks about the defect for 1+ hour per day)
        * Concerns about appearance lead to repetitive behaviours (mirror checking, excessive grooming)/ comparing appearance with someone elses
        * clinically significant distress or psychosocial impairment resulting from the appearance concerns
        * the appearance preoccupations are not better accounted for by an eating disorder
    + differential diagnosis
        * obvious defects
        * normal concerns (dependent on how bad the defect is, the amount of time they are thinking about it)
        * eating disorders (both syndromes involve a disorted body image and dissatisfaction about appearance)
        * unipolar majore depression
        * social anxiety disorder
        * agoraphobia
        * panic disorder
        * generalised anxiety disorder
        * OCD (similar, but in BDD the preoccuipations are soley on image -- and the insight is poor in this condition)
        * psychotic disorders (but BDD lacks the other features)
- classification
    + severity (degree of insight)
        * fair/ poor/ delusional beliefs 
- clinical
    + assessment
        * examination may be difficult@the patient may not want it
        * use the questionairere (BDD questionairre) - 4 questions and has very good SN
    + presentation  
        * vain, may conceal parts of their appearance
        * very poor insight into their condition and imagine the flaws to be real
- approach
    + express empathy @causes lots of suffering -- dont just reassure the patient and say they look fine this will NOT work! do not minimize the patients concerns. 
    + on history: normalise that  people often dont like their appearance and then say does this apply to you
    + dont use judgemental terms like deformity or abnormality, just use broad questions
    + Again, do NOT try and argue with the patient, this will NOT work!
- treatment
    + establish therapeutic alliance by expressing empathy
    + educate the patient about BDD and why you believe that the treatment will help them
    + explain that people with BDD see themselves very negatively and differently from how other people see them (over focussing on details of appearance)
        * usually not helpful to mention the patients appearance or comment that they look fine
    + CBT
    + Pharma
        * SSRI, with followupp to monitor for the occasional transitory side effect and compliacne
    + Followup
        * monitoring of BDD symptoms
            - what is the total time each day you think about appearance
            - how much distress is caused
            - does the concerns you have impact your functioning
    + Discourage all cosmetic interventions (these interventions usually do not help!) -- BDD is a contraindication to eleective rhinoplasty, all patients that want rhinoplasty should be screened for BDD
        * procedures may actually worsen the condition
    + Referral if the BDD is severe

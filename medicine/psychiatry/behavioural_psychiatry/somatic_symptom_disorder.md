###### Somatic symptom disorders
The field of medicine that deals with diseases that appear to have no proportional biological origin for the symptoms experienced by the patient, that would generally have predictable etiologies when dealing with a medical patient. 

An SSD is a type of *Medically unexplained syndrome* (or medically unexplained physical symptoms)
- this description is not used as much, it is generally assumed when this term is being used that the symptoms in question are caused by psychiatric illness.
- it is estimated that 15-30% of primary care consultations are caused by MUS
- as of the DSM-5, the new term is:
    + *Somatic symptom disorder* (this is the current DSM-5 description that should be used)
- this is effectivelty the overarching term for somatization disorders (in the group fo medically unexplained syndrome). SSD makes it easier to diagnose the condition and decreases variability of diagnosis. but other terms are used:
    + Somatoform disorder (this was the DSM-4 definition)
    + psychosomatic
    + hypochondriasis "illness anxiety disorder" (misinterpretation of normal bdy symptoms as serious disease despite reassurance now fits under SSD as of the DSM-5 manual)
    + undifferentiated somatoform disorder
    + pain disorder
    + somatisation disorder
    + pain disorder
    + undifferentiatede somatofrom disorder

Then there are other more specific terms to describe more specific phenomena
- Munchausen's syndrome: actively feigning an illness for some kind of gain (financial or otherwise)
- Morgellon's disease (delusional infestation): a delusion specifically




# Terms to describe somatisation illnesses, contemporary use
- psychosomatic: has become to mean neurotic 
- abnormal illness behaviour: describing an illness which cannot be diagnosed or treated organically because the derangment exists in the mind
- somatoform: not used anymore, was used in DSM-3/4
- Muchausen's: someone is deliberately feigning an illness for some kind of gain
- Functional illness: used in Europe, but not much use in the psych fraternity (for insurance money, get out of the army)
- Medically unexplained syndrome: losing favor (no identifiable organic cause based on tests or clinical diagnosis)
- Hysteria: pejorative meaning, gender laden term
- Factitious: feigning a symptom, but not consciously aware of the motivations 
- Hypochondriasis: (aka illness anxiety)
- Malingering: outright fraud, not a psych disorder


# P
- Fibromyalgia: A rheumatological diagnosis, but psychiatrist see this as a variant of depression. 
- Multiple chemical sensitivity: people that believe that they have reactions to all modern substances, very little organic basis. 
- Chronic fatigue syndrome (Myalgic encephalomyelitis): years of fatigue
- Conversion disorder: apparent neurological disorder that has no neuroogical basis

# Somatic symptom disorder
    hypochondriasis
    fibromyalgia
    irritable bowel syndrome

the diagnoses of fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome do not necessarily come under the diagnosis of SSD, they may be distinct entities. 

# Somatic symptom disorder
- core feature is presence of one or more current somatic symptom that is long standiing and cause distress/ impairment infunctioning. 
- a problem with this condition is tha tpoften the patient is over-assessed and this can lead to further anxiety and significant health costs, and also the chance of false negative results. testing rarely reassures pateints -- shown that the symptom resolution rate is similar between tested and non tested. 
- the important feature that distinguishes this from standard concern about a symptom is that the amount of concern is disproportional to the severity of the symptom -- so even just having significant anxiety about a mild symptom (in the absence of a medical diagnosis) fills the criteria of SSD. 
- classification
    + Severity classification
        * PHQ-15 (patient health questionairre) is used to determine severitty of symptoms
        * SSS-8 also grades severity
- medical
    + mx: mental illness (inflammation in the brain somewhere), due to a background of some form of anxiety/ depressive disorder.
- diagnosis
    + screening tools
        * Whiteley index (the most studied measure for health anxiety)
    + criteria (DSM-5)
        * one or more of the symptoms are causing significant disruption in daily life
        * excessive thoughts/ feelings/ behaviours related to the somatic ysmptoms associated with ehlath concerns as manifested by at least one of the following:
            - disoproprittionate and persistent houghts about the seriousness of one's symptoms
            - persistenyl high level of anxiety about health or symptoms
            - excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health concerns
        * one specific somatic symptom may not be continuously present, the state of being symptomatic is persistent (typically more than 6 months)
        * further categorisation 
            - predominant pain? or another symptom
            - mild/ moderate severe (based on the deegree of psychosocial impairment and multitude of symptoms)
            - persistency? (>over 6 months is persistent)
- clinical
    + presentation
        * history
            - often PC is vague/ inconsistent
            - health care concners are rarely alleivated, reassurance may only give temporary relief, or that hte clinician is not taking them seriously.
            - act of repeating checking one's body for abnormalities
            - unusually high sensitivity to medication side effects
            - seeking care from multiple doctors, or changing doctors frequently.
            - feeling frustrated when interviewing the patient
            - insight: what is the degree to which the patient feels that their concerns about their health may be excessive.
            - important to ascertain what the patient thinks is the underlying condition
            - developmental: may report that parents were only attentive when they were sick
            - psych: past history of anxiety disorder/ depression etc.
    + managment
        * approach





            - take full history, examination, laboratory investigations, psych history and mental status examination.
            - must establish trust and make the patient feel that their concenrs have been listened to.
            - treat the symptoms as real - they are perceived as real and cause great distress - but explain the diagnosis you are giving them. many patients are able to accept the diagnosis if presented correctly.
            - stress that it is good news that nothing to explain the symptoms were found
                + dont say the symptoms are 'all in your head'
            - recognise that hte symptoms they are experiencing can cause severe burden on the patient.



# Delusional infestation (Ekbom's disease)
- fixed false belief that they are infected by some form of organism (like parasites). the false belief is impossible to correct with reasoning/ logical argument. 
- usu the individual remains functional with mild impact. 
- this is the most common form of Monosymptomatic hypochonriacal psychosis
- either primary or secondary (eg due to antoher psychiatric disorder or drug use)
- similar to Morgellon's disease, which is a form of delusional infestation, but the patient believes that there are inanimate objects present in teh lesion as well.

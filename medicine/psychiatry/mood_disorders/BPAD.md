###### BPAD 
    Bipolar I disorder
    Bipolar II disorder
    Bipolar III disorder
    Bipolar IV disorder
    Cyclothymia

# Classification
- Bipolar I disorder: manic +/- depressive episodes
- Bipolar II disorder: hypomanic episodes + depressive episodes
- Bipolar III disorder: Depressed patients who develop hypomania during treatment for depression
- Bipolar IV: Depressed pateints with substance induced hyopomania
- Cyclothymia: dysphoric episodes alternatic with hypo-mania

------------------------------------------------------

### Treatment

# Treatment of phases of BPAD
- acute mania
    + lithium, antipsychotic, anticonvulsant for elevated mood
- acute depression
    + antidepressant in combination with mood stabiliser
    + use of antidepressant may cause transition to mania (esp TCAs and venlafaxine, SSRIs much lower likelihood)
- prophylaxis
    + mood stabiliser

# Ongoing Investigations
- lithium tests
    + baseline thyroid function, UEC, urinalsis, creatinine clearance, FBE
    + ECG
    + especially in older women, then repeat TSH, T3, T4 every 6 months
    + ongoing lithium levels due to narrow therapeutic index (maintain within 0.4-0.8, >1.5 causes toxicity in some people

-------------------------------------------------------


# Clinical
presentation
- manic symptoms
    + elevated mood
    + irritable mood
    + increased self esteem/ grandiosity
    + increased talkativeness
    + flight of ideas
    + distractivility
    + risk taking behaviour
    + increased seuxal iactivity/ thoughts
    + decreased need for sleep

# Treatment
- mood stabilisers
- atypical antispychotics
- ECT may be indicated in some cases
- clozapine and lithium (in suicidal bipolar patients)
- psychological (education, adjustemnt lifestyle, harm reduction)

# Bipolar I disorder
- basics
    + manic episode, preceded and potentially followed by hypomanic/ major depressive episodes. the manic episodes are the distinguishing factor from BP2D
- diagnosis
    + DSM-5 
        * MANIC EPISODE
            - (a) distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated expansive/ irritable mood and abnormally/ perisstenly increased activity lasting >1 week and present most of the day, most days
            - (b) during the period of increased energy, 3+ of the followingare present
                + grandiosity
                + decreased need for sleep
                + more talkative than usual/ pressure talking
                +  flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing
                +  distractibillity
                +  increase in gold directed activity / psychomotor agitation
                +  excessive involvement in activitiese that have a high potential for painful consequences
            -  (c) mood disturbance is severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning
            -  (d) episode is not attributable to physiological effects of a substance or medical condition
        *  HYPOMANIC EPISODE
            -  A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least four consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.
            - B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted, represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant degree:
                1) Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
                2) Decreased need for sleep (eg, feels rested after only three hours of sleep).
                3) More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
                4) Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
                5) Distractibility (ie, attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.
                6) Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation.
                7) Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (eg, engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).
            - C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.
            - D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.
            - E. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic.
            - F. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (eg, a drug of abuse, a medication, or other treatment).
        * Major depressive episode
            - A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same two-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.
            NOTE: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition.
                1) Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (eg, feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observations made by others (eg, appears tearful). (NOTE: In children and adolescents can be irritable mood.)
                2) Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).
                3) Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (eg, a change of more than 5 percent of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (NOTE: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
                4) Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
                5) Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
                6) Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
                7) Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).
                8) Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by their subjective account or as observed by others).
                9) Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.
            B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
            C. The episode is not attributable to the direct physiological effects of a substance or to another medical condition.
            D. The occurence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.

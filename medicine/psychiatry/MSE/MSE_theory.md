# Behaviour
- psychomotor activity
    + gait on entry/ posture on sitting
    + increased/ decreased general activity
    + extraneous movements (tremors/ tics)
    + facial expressions
    + eye contact (interviewer, other parts of room/ downcast)
    + limb movements (dramatic)
    + tearfulness/ laughing


# Speech
- concerns the motor aspects of forming speech
- consider the following
    + volume (loud/ soft)
    + prosody/ rhythm (monotone/ variability)
    + pressure of speech (rapid, urgent, uninterruptable speech)
    + dysarthria
    + dysphasia (disorder of language expression or comprehension)

# Mood
# Affect
- observable feeling state of the patient during the interview
- categories
    + quality
        * perplexity, fatuous, sad, happy, depressed, anxious, angry
    + intensity
        * stregth: qualified with judgement of intensity (mild, moderate, marked)
        * depth
    + dynamics
        * range
        * reactivity
            - lability: rapid changes in affect eg sadness to euphoria (mania)
            - irritability: rapid escalation into anger
            - flatness: restrictions of tone/ affect (Seen in depression)
    + congruence
        * appropriateness of the quality/ depth of an affect and content of thought/ situation
        * incongruence refers to mismatch, associated with psychosis
    + communication
        * how does the interviewer feel during the consultation. schizophrenia -- detachment from the affect

# Thought
- aims to describe the patients connectivity of ideas and the 'form of thought'
- stream
    + Speed of speech
        * poverty of thought
        * lethargic/ retarded
        * slowing
        * fluent
        * racing thoughts
        * pressured
- form 
    + disordered thought (do not address the topic)
        * absence/ poverty of content (perseveration)
        * thought blocking
        * woolly (imprecise vague thinking)
        * logical, ordered thought
        * circumstantiality/ overinclusive of detail
        * tangentiality - moves off topic, unlike circumstantial they never return
        * derailment
        * word salad (string of disconnected words)
- content
    + Intensity convictions spectrum (spectrum of mismatch between content of thought and what would be considered appropriate for the interview)
        * Spectrum
            - appropriate to interview
            - recurrent themes
            - overvalued ideas (preoccupations) 
            - delusions (most intensely held beliefs)
        * Overvalued ideas: comprehensible idea but pursued beyond reason, with preoccupation of the patient with strong emotional investment. amenable to some reason. must be distinguished from delusions by challenging them
        * Delusions: thought form/ content disorder - fixed/ false beliefs, unshakable with reason. 
    + Thoughts of harm to self or others
    + Obsessions
    + Phobias
flight of ideas - (patient skips over logic that they assume)
slow the patient's speaking down

wooly - bewildering

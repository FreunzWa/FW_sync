# Depression
- mood disorder

# Classification
- by severity
    + minor depression (characterised by fewer symptoms and shorter episodes of depression and is associated with less morbidity) -- probably more common than MDD but it is less diagnosed @less likely to present
        * otherwise refered to: subthreshold depression, subsyndromal/ subclincial depression, depressive symptoms
    + major depression (according to the DSM-5 guidelines)
        * psychotic depression (subtype of unipolar major depression): type of MDD when associated with psychotic features (hallucinations/ delusions)
- unipolar/ bipolar depression
    + unipolar depression is associtaed with mood depression without manic/ mood elevation episodes
    + bipolar depression - part of BPAD
- Other types
    + Vascular Depression
        * CVA increases the risk of pt (esp older) for vulnerability towards the development of depression -- especially if the damage is localised to the left hemisphere




---------------------------------------------------

# Epidemiology
- 15-20% of population in lifetime
    + W:M 2:1, however Males 4x more likely
- 4% in the last month
- ~50% recur, and those with 3+ episodes 80% have recurrent chronic depression
- moderate depression usually lasts for 9 months when untreated
- 2x mortality at any age due to exposure to other risk factors
- risk factors:
    + childhood trauma, traumatic episodes, adversity (ruminative vs. active response)
    + drug use (esp alcohol, GABAergic medications)

-------------------------------------------------------

# As a psychosocial disorder/ predisposing factors
- as a child:
    + parental loss/ poor parenting predisposes to adult depression, also includes disengaged depressed mothers (eg with post partum depression). 
    + higher IQ is protective, as well if there is at least one good relationship
    + CSA, increased risk of affective/ personality/ mood disorders
- adult:
    + risk of depression: continuously married < always single > divorced and then separated
    + increasd risk @dysfunctional intimate other   
- environmental factors:
    + entrapment (most common), danger, humiliation, loss (bereavement)

# Medical 
- associations
    + alcohol, drug abuse, self-medication to decrease anxiety symptoms 
    + Anxiety disorder (usually predates depression)
    + personality disorder (treated in parallel)
- mechanism
    + first episode of depression 
        * usu associated with lifestyle facotrs, then relapse 
    + brain structure changes
        * @longer/ severe course of depression assoc with small hippocampus, ventriculomegaly, -=activation of BDNF, -=reponse to dexamethesane suppression test, changes to HP axis. 


# Classification 

- Winokurs Depressive spectrum
    + states that men present differently to women with the following constellation of symptoms
        * antisocial , alcohol abussing, angry, restive

- Criteria/ Definition in DSM-5
    + 5 of the following (of 8 symptoms):
        * at least one of the following:
            - Anhedonia 
            - Depressed mood
        * other symptoms
            - suicidal ideation/ recurrent thoughts of death
            - feelings of worthlessness/ guilt
            - significant weight change
            - inability to concentrate
            - loss of energy/ chronic fatigue
            - psychomotor retardation
- medical
    + prognosis
        * major complication is suicidal ideation, which maybe a marker of severity

# Clinical assessment


+ differentials
    * Other psychiatric disorders
        - Borderline personality disorder
    * Organic conditions
        - Loss significant
        - Hypothyroidism
        - Cushings
        - Cancer (up to 1/3 of people with cancer has depression)
        - Neurological (depression common post stroke - esp if the infarct, PArkinsons)
        - Multiple sclerosis (may present as depression initially)
        - HIV



+ presentation
    * Neuro-vegetative symptoms
        - Sleep disturbance (terminal insomnia), libidinal changes
    * Cognitive-affective symptoms
        - anxiety, helplessness, social withdrawal, guilt, shame, rage, nihilism, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, worthlessness/ inferiority complex
    * Suicidal ideation
        - may be a marker of severity
        - associated with the following symptoms:
            + insomnia, worthlessness, weight/appetite loss, guilt, thoughts of death, impulsive (lack of planning)/ aggressive
            + phase of recovery (risk of suicidality can increase with treatment in early stages @psychomotor retardation goes away but mood/ affect lag behind)
    * Psychotic symptoms (a marker of severity, mood congruent delusions - that is the psychotic symptoms reflect the underlying mood)
        - 10-20% hallucinations
        - ~100%delusions
        - %constipation (due to psychomotor retardation/ -=mobility == constipation which may cause delusions) 
        - these symptoms are often missed


# Treatment

- indications for ECT
    + melancholic depression 
    + psychotic depression
    + dipolar depression/ mani
    + prominent suicidality
    + poor oral intake
    + puerperal depression

# Variants
- Postpartum depression  
    + 10% of mothers, 50% of these episodes are severe
    + occurs 4-12 weeks post partum
    + 50% risk of recurrence
    + impact on development of the child
    + suicide is the leading cause of maternal death
    + often associated with thyroiditis
- Child Depression

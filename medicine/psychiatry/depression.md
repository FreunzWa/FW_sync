# Epidemiology
- 15-20% of population in lifetime
    + W:M 2:1, however Males 4x more likely
- 4% in the last month
- ~50% recur, and those with 3+ episodes 80% have recurrent chronic depression
- moderate depression usually lasts for 9 months when untreated
- 2x mortality at any age due to exposure to other risk factors
- risk factors:
    + childhood trauma, traumatic episodes, adversity (ruminative vs. active response)
    + drug use (esp alcohol, GABAergic medications)

-------------------------------------------------------

# As a psychosocial disorder/ predisposing factors
- as a child:

            + phase of recovery (risk of suicidality can increase with treatment in early stages @psychomotor retardation goes away but mood/ affect lag behind)
    * Psychotic symptoms (a marker of severity, mood congruent delusions - that is the psychotic symptoms reflect the underlying mood)
        - 10-20% hallucinations
        - ~100%delusions
        - %constipation (due to psychomotor retardation/ -=mobility == constipation which may cause delusions)

###### Mental health Act
- allows treatment for people suffering from pschiatric illnesses who cannot give consent for treatment, due to severe illness, anosagnosia or threat to the community. 
- the most recent version is 2014

# MHA 2014
- criteria for an assessment order for medical doctors or registered psych-health practitioners
    + appears to have a mental illness
    + due to mental illness, the person appears to need immediate treatment to prevent:
        * serious deterioration in mental/ physical health
        * serious harm to the person or another person
    + further assessment is available for the patient's condition'
    + this is the least restrictive method for further assessment (i.e. the patient cannot be voluntarily assessed)

# Principles
- this MHA is a very patient centered mental health act, however perhaps this allows patients to make decisions on their treatment that conflict with physician recommendations


# Process
- Assessment order
    + a medical practitioner can make an AO if they believe person suffering from mental illness and requires compulsory treatment
    + Inpatient AO
        * patient to be transported to hospital within 72 hours
        * @get to hospital, 24 hour period starts for them to be seen by a consultant psychiatrist - will determine if there is mental illness. the period can be extended to 72 hours in exceptional circumstances. 
            - if there is, fulfils requirements of MHA == Temporary treatment order (TTO)
            - if there is not, then the decision is revoked
    + outpatient setting
- TTO
    + after AO assessment, an authorised consultant psychiatrist determines whether psych illness present, and if they need compulsory treatment to prvent harm to self/ others
    + within 28 days, there is a mental health tribunal hearing. if the tribunal is satisfied that the patient needs to be treated involuntarily - then on a treatemnt order for 6-12 months (depending on if CTO or ITO)
    + Forms of TTO:
        * Inpatient (must be inpatient if the patient must be detained) - the TO lasts 6 months
        * Community (if the psych believes the treatment can be adequately given in the community). the CTO can last up to 12 months
    + important to not that the TO must be less than 3 months if the patient is yet to reach age of majority.
- TO (Treatment order)
    + 6-12 
    + at the end of this 12 months, if no improvement == renew treatment period
- the tribunal (3 people)
    + medical practitioner (GP or psychiatrist)
    + lawyer
    + community representative (social worker or something else in the community)

###### Antipsychotics
- 3 main classes: typicals, atypicals, partial agonists -- no efficacy differences at a population level (however individual varies significantly). only differences is tolerability.
- prognosis poor despite high reponse rate for initial psychotic episode due to poor compliance == high relapse rate == enter treatemnt resistant group

# Indications
- psychoses
- schizo-affective disorder
- BPAD  
    + due to the mood stabilising effects of antipsychotic


# Side effects
- typicals (anti-Dopamine)
    + EPSEs
- atypicals (high affinity for 5-HT and Dopamine receptors)
    + less EPSEs, but much more metabolic side effects (muscarinic off target) -- clozapine/ olanzapine the worst for metabolic
        * the metabolic side effects @++carbohydrate cravings and ++storage of fat
- partial agonists
    + eg aripiprazole/ brexpiprazole. avoid hyperdopaminergic state and avoid total dopamine withdrawal. these drugs will be used more and more @more data @anticipated fewer side effects

# Goals of treatment
- maintenance is vital due to high rate of relapse @withdraw treatment due to lack of compliance. @relapse, 1/6 == treatment resistant group and lose function

# Consequences of treatment
- @long term treatment == hypersensitivity to dopamine == @abrupt cessation == severe psychotic withdrawal episode ('rebound psychosis'). Depo injections are better @longer period of elimination halflife.
- assuming compliance
    + emergence of 2ndary negative symptoms

- if there is a relapse, then more likely to enter the treamtent resistant group of schizophrenia. 

# Atypical antipsychotics

Clozapine
- clozapine first atypical, but poorly tolerated -- in some considered to be the most efficacious, only used in treatment resistant psychosis -- 30% in this group will respond to clozapine. 
    + agranulocytosis/ cardiomyopathy/ myocarditis/ extremely severe chronic constipation
- very weak D2 blocker, reduces dopamine through other pathway
- only indicated for treatment resistant psychosis (thought to be different mechanistically)

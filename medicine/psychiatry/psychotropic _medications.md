###### Psychotropic medications

# Broad class usages

# Antipsychotics
- can also be used in adjunct with antidepressants to augment efficacy for antidepressants.


--------------------------------------------
#### Drug list

# Antipsychotics
- typicals rarely used @++risk of Tardive dyskinesia/ EPSEs, atypicals much less likely to == this.
    - metabolic side effects most common (weight gain/ T2DM), %sedation, insomnia, agitation, constipation, dry mouth, cardiac
- First (Typical) generation antipsychotics
    + Chlorpromazine
- Second (Atypical) generation antipsychotics
    + Olanzapine
        * ses: ++weight gain
    + Risperidone
        * ses: prolactinaemia
    + Quetiapine
        * ses: QTc prolongation
    + Clozapine
        * ses: potentially lethal cardiomyopathy/ agranulocytosis, %myocarditis - get haem monitoring. ++weight gain
            - weekly for 18 weeks, then monthly for rest of time.
        * reserved @failed two other treatment trials
    + Aripiprazole and Brexpiprazole are both D2 partial agonist.

# Mood stabilisers
- Lithium
    + ses: thirsty, metallic taste in mouth
    + c: must monitor levels regularly to prevent becoming lithium toxic
- Anticonvulsants
    + Sodium Valproate
- Atypical antipsychotics




# Antidepressants
- informing the use today of antidepressants is the relative tolerability not the efficacy (as they are all fairly equal)

- Indications
    + MDD
    + Various anxiety disorders
        * Panic disorder
        * Obsessive compulsive disorder (SSRI)
        * Gerenalised anxiety disorder
        * Post traumatic disorder
    + Other conditions
        * Neuropathic pain states (++TCAs, %SNRIs)
- Placement of antidepressant therapy on the spectrum of severity
    + Sadness (reassurance, psychotherapy)
    + Mild depression (psychotherapy)
    + Moderate depression (psychotherapy + medication)
    + Severe depression (medication (+psychotherapy) +/- ECT)
    + Psychotic depression (medication +/- antipsychotic/ ECT)
- Efficacy
    + Slow onset of action 2-4 weeks before ++improvement
        * %see mild improvemnt in vegetative symptoms (sleep better)
        * however full recovery rarely <6 weeks.
    + slightly more effective than placebo
        * response rates 70-80% (however 60-70% do not respond to the first drug)
        * placebo rates 30-40%
    + very commonly have to cycle through multiple medications to reach one with efficacy for a given patient
    + no differences in response rates between classes or within a class
- Classes
    + TCAs
        * poorly tolerated, old drugs, introduced 1950s. seldom used.  
        * side effects
            - adrenergic block
            - overdose
            - anti-SLUDGE
            - cariac arrhytmias
    + MAOi
        * requires dietary restriction, seldom used. 
        * serotonin syndrome @high tyramine foods of chocolate/ cheese/ wine
    + BZDs
    + Dual Acting drugs (serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors)
        * non selective, inhibition of both serotonin and NAdr reuptake. 
        * Examples
            - Venlafaxine, Duloextine, Desvenlafaxine
            - abrupt discontinuation == withdrawal syndrome (esp venlafaxine)
        * SEs
            - nausea, dry mouth, contimpation, insonenia
            - diarrehoea, appetite decreased, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, increased sweating (common)
            - %sexual dysfux, tremor, hyponatremia, palpiations/ tachy, lower seizure treshold (rare)
    + SSRIs
        * since 1980s, better tolerated, thus first line
        * most commonly used are escitalopram and sertraline (@better marketing and less d-d interactions)
            - fluoxetine (Prozac): long half life 5 days, with an active metabalite of 10 days (thus takes long time to stop)
            - Citalopram (racemic mixture)
            - Escitalopram (single isomeric form)
            - Sertraline, good d-d interaction profile
            - Paroxetine, assoc with withdrawal syndrome (due to non-linear pharmacokinetic profile)
            - Fluvoxamine (marketing issue) - seldom used, often used in adolescent OCD however. 
        * most antidepressants not approved for use in children, the only one with approval is Fluoxetine.
        * side effects
            - increase serotonin symptoms 
                + autonomic (GI disturbance)
                + can cause somnolence and insomnia (thus for use preferably in morning)
                + anxiety/ restlessness
                + dizziness/ headaches
                + Hyponatremia/ SIADH
                + increased suicidal ideation (esp in children)
                + sexual dysfunction (very common)
    + Selective Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI)
        * alt choice to SSRIs, usu in more severe depression (but their use it often determined by prescribing patterns)
    + Multi-modal agents
        * Alpha-2-antagonists (Mirtazapine)
            - meant to cause 'relief of symptoms of depression', mild anti-anxiety effect
            - not used frequently as antidepressant alone @poorly tolerated, however often combined with other antidepressant as a small dose at night to take advantage of sedation effect
            - ses
                + assoc with blood dyscrasia (variations of pancytopaeania) usu @old
                + sedative
                + weight gain (10-15+ kgs within weeks - induction of carb craving)
        * Vortioxetine
            - combined 5HT reuptake inhibitor, and 5HT1A/ 5HT3 agonist
            - risk of 5HT syndorme @combined with other 5HT medications (eg SSRIs or MAOis)
        * Agomelatine
            - Melatonin agonist
            - not on PBS
            - can be also used for sleep wake disorders (late waking)
            - ses:
                + transaminase increase, blurred vision, eczema, ND, fatigue, somnolence
        * Ketamine
            - only experimental use

# Anxiolytic agents
- usu used @sleep disturbance, short term treatment of anxiety, panic attacks, generalised anxiety disorders, phobic disorders
- not very good for OCD, simple phobia, must be avoided in PTSD
- are also used in status epilepticus
- higher doses in panic disorders
- benzodiazepine hypnotics are used maximum for a few days (temazepam is the most common)
    + triazolam very short acting
- ses
    + %social disinhibition (hostility, rage reaction, %sexual)
    + psychomotor impairment (issue around driving)

    + cognitive impairment
    + overdose == respitratory depression
- examples
    + Buspirone (azapirone)
        * very slow onset of action opposed to BDZs
        * mild-moderate GAD
        * no dependence/ withdrawal syndrome
        * can use the medication longer term, at least months
        * not on the PBS 
    + Benzodiazepines
        * alprazolam (restricted drug due to withdrawal syndrome/ reinforcing effect), bromazpeam, diazpeam, clobazam, lorazepam, oxazepam

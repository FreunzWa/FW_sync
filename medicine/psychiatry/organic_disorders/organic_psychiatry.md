###### Organic psychiatry

# TLE
- presentation asscoiated with temporal lobe epilepsy
    + metallic taste
    + rising epigastric sensation
    + deja vu
        * out of body experience    
    + short time duration
    + often misdiagnosed @anxiety disorders until treating team sees full TC seizure
    + confused in post-ictal period
    + automatisms (lip smacking, hand fumbling, repetitive hand movements)
- Rx: Keppra, Lamotrigine, Epilim, Tegretol

# Delirium 2nd to alcohol withdrawal
- alcohol withdrawal - day 3 presentation, and features consistent (alcoholic hallucinosis - esp spiders on the wall)
- collateral history imporant @cannot provide history
- LFTs, FBE, CRP, CXR, ECG, drug screen, CT head (eg slow subdural bleed) 
- give thiamine

# Huntington's disease
- presents with choreiform neurological features
- family history of AD early death
- cognitive testing: MMSE + frontal assessment, NUCOG

# FTD
- associated with MND -- screen for this
- frontal assessment battery
- VAPER
    + verbal fluency (name words beginning with f)
    + abstraction (what does painting and poem have in common)
    + personality change
    + estimation
    + repetitive movements
- neurological defects (loss of disinhibition from the frontal lobe)
    + primitive refelexes emerge
    + snout
    + palmo-mental
    + grasp
    + morrow reflex


# CJD, rapidly progressive disease
- MRI: %see signs, the pulvinar sign
- CSF: 14-3-3 protein, fairly non specific. marker for "brain rot" in general
myoclonic jerks assocatied with clozapine -- is a proconvulsant , lowers threshold for seizures

# OCG
- antisychotics
    + typical antipsychotics, less assoc with atypicals

# TD
- clozapine may actually help with symptoms of TD

# LBD
- intolerance to neuroleptics
- vivid hallucaintions
- rem sleep disorders



Charles-Bonnet syndrome
-- esp with cataracts get vivid hallucinations


# Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES)
- associated with significant mortality
- substance use
- psych history - history of trauma (bereavement)
- family history of seizures/ MH
- epilim shouldnt have been started ,need EEG before hand to confirm diagnosis and child bearing age -- Valproate is teratogenic.
- seizures, typically bite the sides of the tongue rather than the tip
- investigatons: MRI looking for mass occupying lesions, EEG, sleep deprived EEG, valproate levels, electrolyte levels
- do the seizures cluster (typically with epilepsy the seizures cluster), video telemtry unit for seizrues (for psychogenic non-epileptic seizures)

# NMDA- receptor autoimmune
- teratoma in the brain == autoimmune activation

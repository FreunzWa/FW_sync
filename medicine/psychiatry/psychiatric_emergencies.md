###### Psychiatric emergencies

# Acutely suicidal patient
- myth that asking about suicidal ideation causes increased risk, actually the opposite is true. 
- evaluation
    + degree of risk (dynamic risk vs static risk)
        * biological risk (male, 20-25 or 65+, acutely suicidal patient, substance use)
        * pyschologicla risk (past history of attempts, hopelessness, insomnia, irritability, anhedonia, psychitatric history, suicidal history, belief that parents are uncaring)
        * environmental (access to means, change in future plans, recent illlness didangosis, recent suicide in community, stressful life event, limited social supports)
    + establish a rapport before direct questions are asked
    + CPR history
        * current ideation/ plan/ intent 
            - details: access to means, potentially lethal, any provision to being saved
        * past history
        * resources
            - internal (coping, personality style)
            - external (supports/ accommodation)
    + MSE
- managment
    + tools (SAD PERSONS scale assesses suicide risk/ CAMS - collab assessment and man of suicidality, C-SSRS)
    + stratify low/ medium/ high risk
        * low risk: not having attempted suicide 2+ times before AND no recent suicidal ideation. no changese to treatment. treat depression etc.
        * moderate risk: 2+ attempts before or recent suicidal ideation. 
            - monitor change in suicide risk
            - consideer medication treatment
            - consider MH referral (psychiatrist/ psychologist)
        * high risk: recent suicidal plan but no preparations OR 2+ times attempted with suicidal ideation
            - crisis response plan
            - means restriction counselling (harm reduction strats)
            - refer to MH
        * imminent: active planning
            - hospitalisation
    + treat comorbid psychiatric illness
        * insomnia - hypnotics/ mirtazipine/ benzos
        * depression
        * anxiety - prn diazepam for severe or long term antidepressants 
    + safety plan
        * identification of warning signs
        * have some internal coping strategies (things can do to calm self)
            - 'hope box' -- pictures of fammilyl/ friends etc.
            - list of reasons for living -- look at this list when feeling suicidal
        * distraction techqnques
            - listen to music
            - watch movies
            - bath
            - pets
            - go for a walk
            - dont drink at home alone
            - medications
                + ask carers for medication -- diazepam @feel lvery stressed
        * family/ friends numbers for crisis help
            - peoiple can call if feeling suicidal
        * professionals/ help agencies
            - KIDS helpline/ Lifeline
            - In a crisis, should come to ED
            - CATT 
    + referral to public MH services
        * referto adolescent MH/ child and adolescent public mental health service
        * CATT (reponds to urgeent requests to help people in mental health crisis 24/7 -- can include self harm, psychotic episode, suicidal ideation. can help get to hospital or facilitate treatemnt at home)
    + harm reduction
        * keep knives and mmedciations in locked places
    + initial management by clinician
        * risk profile
        * mental state assessment
        * involve parents/ family
        * psychoeducation about suicide risk and underling psychological condition
        * hospitalisation? 
        * involvement of other health professional and services (crisis assessment, public mental health service, private psychologist/ psyhicatarist)
        * develop safety plan - aka crisis plan
        * consider psychotroptic medication or psychosocial intervention (antidepressants, CBT for MDD)
        * document everything, risk assessment, MSE, safety plan
        * review and followup
    + emeergency management fo acutely suicidal patient
        * calm and direct approach to history, empathic and free of biases
        * environmental/ harm reduction
            - private room without access to potentially dangerous objects (belts, sharps, shoelaces)
        * verbal-de-escalation of the patient (dont crowd the patient)
        * investigations: toxicology screens, ECG (QT and overdose drugs).
        * Examination: self harm evidence, pupils (pinpoint @opioid overdose) and MSE
        * risk assessment (plan, past attepmts, family history of attempt,s MH history, substance use, irritability etc.)
        * physical and chemical restraints can be traumatic to the patient/ famiily
        * @acute agitation can treat as an acutely agitated patient (ie. sedation)
        * discharge plllanning
            - outpatient appointment, referral to health serrvices in teh community, safety plan can be written @psychologist/ psych etc
            - can be dischargede @suicidal lrisk is acceptably low


# Violent patient
- most violent people in society are not mentally ill, though the incidence of violent patients is higher in psychiatry
- differentials for violent patient
    + psychiatric disorder
    + neurological disorder/ delirium/ BPSD
    + intoxication/ withdrawal
    + those who perceive violent acts/ urges as unwanted
- clinical
    + presentation  
        * raised voice, yelling, swearing
        * increased muscle tension (eg gripping arms/ sitting on edge of chair)
        * hyperactivity (pacing)
        * slammin gdoors, knocking over furniture
- approach
    + harm reduction
        * never interview patient with weapon, if unwilling to reliquish weapon, then get security
    + environemntal modification
        * dont interview in cramped rooms, both have access to a door
- treatment 
    + call code grey/ black, call security
    + combination of BZDs and atypical sedating antipsychotics
    + non-pharmacological
        * create opportunity for patient to vent anger/ express fears (ventilation)
        * explore with patient what interventions would assist to gain control (redirection)
        * assess time out 5-15min duration for patient to try to regain control (time out)
        * physical restraint @situation warrants
        * seclusion (expllanation must be givrene to patient and staff)
        * debriefing after episode passes
    + pharmacological
        * First line (arousal level 2-3) -- moderate arousal, agitated, becoming more vocal, still willing to talk reasonably
            - Use one of:
                + BZDs: oral lorazepam 1-2.5/ diazepam 5-10mg (used @more sedation required than antipsychotic effect)
                + Atypical antipsychotic: PO Olanzapine 5-10mg, PO Risperidone 1-2mg (risperidone used @-=sedation needed)
                + Review in 30-60 minutes. Repeat or move on to step 2. 
            - help patient to gain control, provide suggestions, give time out (but not seclusion)
        * Second line (Arousal level 3-4) -- unreasonable, hostile, highly aroused
            - Use both of:
                + Atypical antipsychotic: PO Olanzapine 10-20mg OR Risperidone 2-4 mg
                + BZD: PO Lorazepam 1-2.5mg OR Diazepam 5-10mg
        * Third line (Arousal level 4-5 or rejecting oral medications) -- refusing oral medication, highly aroused, distressed, potentially violent
            - Use the following as a IM injection
                + Atypicals: Olanzapine IM 10mg every 2 hours, max 40 mg/ day OR Ziprasidone Mesilate IM 10mg every 2 hours or 20mg every 4 hours, max 40mg per day (requires ECG/ K+ monitoring)
                + BZDs: IM Clonazepam 1-2mg OR Midazolam IM 0.1mg/kg (if more rapid sedation is required)
                + Accuphasee used in separate protocol

# Neuroleptic malignant syndrome 
- life threatening complication of antipsychotic treatment (10-20% mortality), death due to dysautonomic feature so fhte disease and systemic complications. 
- epidemiology
    +  approx 0.02-3% fo patients taking neurleptic agents, more often men
-  medical
    +  mx
        *  unknown cause, theorized to be @dopamine receptor blockade (central dopamine blockade of the hypothalamus) == temperature and autonomic dysregulation 
    +  etiology
        *  major tranqs (esp 1st generation) but %2nd generation
            -  haloperidol, fluphenazine +++
            -  also atypicals, almost every neuroleptic
    +  associated with dehydration - unknown if this is risk factor or manifestation of NMS
    +  similar to neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome or parkinsonism hyperpyrexia caused @withdrawal to dopamine acgents
- clinical
    + risk factors
        * taking high dose first generation antipsychotics (haloperidol/ fluphenazine), however almost every clas of neuroleptic has been implicated. 
        * genetic risk factors - shown to be an association with polymorphism of the D2 receptor gene. 
    + presentation:
        * mental status change (agitated delirium with confusion, not psychosis. often overlookede @poor specificity for NMS)
        * neuromuscular rigidity (generalised, also assoc with dysphagia, dysphasia, dystonia)
        * dysautonomia (tachy, high/labvile BP)
        * hyperpyrexia (very high, 38, but 40 not uncommon). fever is less common @taking g2 antipsychtoics
- diagnsosi
    + made @clinical syndrome in a patient taking an associated medication, with lab scores taken into consideration (there are scoring systems)
- differentials
    + malignant hyperthermia, malignant catatonia, SS, drug related syndromes, ecnephalitis/edema and other organic brain conditions
    + 
- investigations
    + Bloods: 
        * profoundly elevated CK (@severe rigidity). may be relatively normal @less muscular rigidity associated. not specific to NMs ,also assoc many psych patients @receiving intramuscular injections/ psychical restraints/ agitation. however when gets very high then quite SP for NMS, and correlates with disease severity/ prognosis 
        * elevated CK/ Leukocytosis, ++%with left shift
        * electrolyte: hypocalcemia, hypoMg, hypoNa/ hyperNa, hyperK, metabolic acidosis
        * renal failure late stage @rhabdomyolysis
    + CSF
        * LP to rule out encephalitis @infection or autoimmune/ paraneoplastic
    + imaging
        * CT/MRI usually taken to rule out organic brain disease
- treatment
    + DRSABCDEF
    + discontinue antipsychotic medications and other possible contributors where possible (eg lithium/ antidepressants and other psychotropics)
    + resuscitation (usually in ED/ ICU)
    1. respiratory support (oxygen ==> intubation/ ICU @required)
    2. cardiovascular support (bring down @++BP acutely with clonidine/ nitroprusside)
    3. temperature control (cool fluids, ice packs in the axilla, gastric lavage with cool fluids)
    4. medications (bromocriptine, dantrolene, benzodiazepines have evidence to support use)
    5. prevent other complications assoc with severe illness and long term hospital stay

# Serotonin syndrome
- @interaction of SSRIs, combined with MAOis/ lithium/ tryptophan
- classical triad
    + neurological
    + autonomic
    + mental state
- treatment
    + stop all psychotropic medication
    + supportive/ intubation
    + cryproheptidine if temperature >41.1


# ECT
- EEG monitoring to detemrine seizure duration, and stimulus dose titration (smallest possible dose of current to get symptomatic improvement)
- ECG monitoring
- sedation, muscle relaxation, fasting, cannot drink for 2 hours before. 
- indicated for sever major depression, mania, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder
- contraindciations
    + reaised intracranial pressure, brain tumor, cochlear implants (requires removal but this is difficult), hyperthyroidism, anaesthetic risks
- there is a cuff which prevents entry of hte muscle relaxant into the right leg - to detect seizure duration.
- clinicians step away when dose is being given. 
- side effects
    + confusion, amneisa, persistent memory disturbance, headache/ muscle aches, nausea
- Thymatron IV

- baseline EEG
EEG phases
- recruiting phase
    + low amplitude fast activity
- tonic phase
    + bilateral synchrnous (synchrony between left and right hemispheres)
- clonic phase
    + high amplitude, polyspike and underlying slow wave complexes
- postictal suppression
    + flattening out of the large waves

- hypotheses of mechanism
    + anticonvulsant hyptehsis
    + cerebral inhiibiotn
    + neurochemical hypotehsis
    + neuroendocrine hypothesis

# Other stimulating treatments
- TMS (transcranial magnetic stmiulation)
- DCS (direct current stimulation)
- MST (magnetic stimulation treatment)
- VNS (vagal nerve stimulation)
- DBS (deep brain stimulation) - most invasive



# Refeeding syndrome
- medical
    + mx
        * biocontext: @low CHO == low insulin secretion == ++fat catabolism == ++FFA/ ketones (low glucose). @severe starvantion == K/ Mg/ PO4 depleted body stores to maintain serum levels. 
        * refeeding == ++CHO metabolosim == ++insulin release == ++PO4/ K/ Mg into cells == fall in serum conc == severe electrolyte abn. 
        * time course: 3-4 days after refeeding.

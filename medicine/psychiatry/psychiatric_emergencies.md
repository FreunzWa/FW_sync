###### Psychiatric emergencies

# Acutely suicidal patient
- evaluation
    + establish a rapport before direct questions are asked
    + CPR history
        * current ideation/ plan/ intent 
            - details: access to means, potentially lethal, any provision to being saved
        * past history
        * resources
            - internal (coping, personality style)
            - external (supports/ accommodation)
    + MSE


# Violent patient
- most violent people in society are not mentally ill, though the incidence of violent patients is higher in psychiatry
- differentials for violent patient
    + psychiatric disorder
    + neurological disorder/ delirium
    + intoxication/ withdrawal
    + those who perceive violent acts/ urges as unwanted
- approach
- treatment 
    + combination of BZDs and atypical sedating antipsychotics
    + First line (arousal level 2-3)
        * oral lorazepam/ diazepam OR olanzapine. Review in 30-60 minutes. Repeat or move on to step 2. 
    + Second line (Arousal level 3-4)
    + Third line (Arousal level 4-5 or rejecting oral medications)
        * intramuscular Olanzapine/ Clonazepam/ Ziprasidone Mesilate

# Neuroleptic malignant syndrome 
- life threatening complication of antipsychotic treatment (10-20% mortality)
- clinical
    + presentation: muscular rigidity, autonomic symptoms, akinesia, mutism
- investigations
    + elevated CK/ Leukocytosis
- treatment
    + supportive/ cease antipsychotic, ICU
    + Dantrolene / bromocryptine is an option

# Serotonin syndrome
- @interaction of SSRIs, combined with MAOis/ lithium/ tryptophan
- classical triad
    + neurological
    + autonomic
    + mental state
- treatment
    + stop all psychotropic medication
    + supportive/ intubation
    + cryproheptidine if temperature >41.1


# ECT
- EEG monitoring to detemrine seizure duration, and stimulus dose titration (smallest possible dose of current to get symptomatic improvement)
- ECG monitoring
- sedation, muscle relaxation, fasting, cannot drink for 2 hours before. 
- indicated for sever major depression, mania, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder
- contraindciations
    + reaised intracranial pressure, brain tumor, cochlear implants (requires removal but this is difficult), hyperthyroidism, anaesthetic risks
- there is a cuff which prevents entry of hte muscle relaxant into the right leg - to detect seizure duration.
- clinicians step away when dose is being given. 
- side effects
    + confusion, amneisa, persistent memory disturbance, headache/ muscle aches, nausea
- Thymatron IV

- baseline EEG
EEG phases
- recruiting phase
    + low amplitude fast activity
- tonic phase
    + bilateral synchrnous (synchrony between left and right hemispheres)
- clonic phase
    + high amplitude, polyspike and underlying slow wave complexes
- postictal suppression
    + flattening out of the large waves

- hypotheses of mechanism
    + anticonvulsant hyptehsis
    + cerebral inhiibiotn
    + neurochemical hypotehsis
    + neuroendocrine hypothesis

# Other stimulating treatments
- TMS (transcranial magnetic stmiulation)
- DCS (direct current stimulation)
- MST (magnetic stimulation treatment)
- VNS (vagal nerve stimulation)
- DBS (deep brain stimulation) - most invasive

###### Psychiatric emergencies

# Acutely suicidal patient
- evaluation
    + establish a rapport before direct questions are asked
    + CPR history
        * current ideation/ plan/ intent 
            - details: access to means, potentially lethal, any provision to being saved
        * past history
        * resources
            - internal (coping, personality style)
            - external (supports/ accommodation)
    + MSE


# Violent patient
- most violent people in society are not mentally ill, though the incidence of violent patients is higher in psychiatry
- differentials for violent patient
    + psychiatric disorder
    + neurological disorder/ delirium
    + intoxication/ withdrawal
    + those who perceive violent acts/ urges as unwanted
- approach
- treatment 
    + combination of BZDs and atypical sedating antipsychotics
    + First line (arousal level 2-3)
        * oral lorazepam/ diazepam OR olanzapine. Review in 30-60 minutes. Repeat or move on to step 2. 
    + Second line (Arousal level 3-4)
    + Third line (Arousal level 4-5 or rejecting oral medications)
        * intramuscular Olanzapine/ Clonazepam/ Ziprasidone Mesilate

# Neuroleptic malignant syndrome 
- life threatening complication of antipsychotic treatment (10-20% mortality), death due to dysautonomic feature so fhte disease and systemic complications. 
- epidemiology
    +  approx 0.02-3% fo patients taking neurleptic agents, more often men
-  medical
    +  mx
        *  unknown cause, theorized to be @dopamine receptor blockade (central dopamine blockade of the hypothalamus) == temperature and autonomic dysregulation 
    +  etiology
        *  major tranqs (esp 1st generation) but %2nd generation
            -  haloperidol, fluphenazine +++
            -  also atypicals, almost every neuroleptic
    +  associated with dehydration - unknown if this is risk factor or manifestation of NMS
    +  similar to neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome or parkinsonism hyperpyrexia caused @withdrawal to dopamine acgents
- clinical
    + risk factors
        * taking high dose first generation antipsychotics (haloperidol/ fluphenazine), however almost every clas of neuroleptic has been implicated. 
        * genetic risk factors - shown to be an association with polymorphism of the D2 receptor gene. 
    + presentation:
        * mental status change (agitated delirium with confusion, not psychosis. often overlookede @poor specificity for NMS)
        * neuromuscular rigidity (generalised, also assoc with dysphagia, dysphasia, dystonia)
        * dysautonomia (tachy, high/labvile BP)
        * hyperpyrexia (very high, 38, but 40 not uncommon). fever is less common @taking g2 antipsychtoics
- diagnsosi
    + made @clinical syndrome in a patient taking an associated medication, with lab scores taken into consideration (there are scoring systems)
- differentials
    + malignant hyperthermia, malignant catatonia, SS, drug related syndromes, ecnephalitis/edema and other organic brain conditions
    + 
- investigations
    + Bloods: 
        * profoundly elevated CK (@severe rigidity). may be relatively normal @less muscular rigidity associated. not specific to NMs ,also assoc many psych patients @receiving intramuscular injections/ psychical restraints/ agitation. however when gets very high then quite SP for NMS, and correlates with disease severity/ prognosis 
        * elevated CK/ Leukocytosis, ++%with left shift
        * electrolyte: hypocalcemia, hypoMg, hypoNa/ hyperNa, hyperK, metabolic acidosis
        * renal failure late stage @rhabdomyolysis
    + CSF
        * LP to rule out encephalitis @infection or autoimmune/ paraneoplastic
    + imaging
        * CT/MRI usually taken to rule out organic brain disease
- treatment
    + DRSABCDEF
    + discontinue antipsychotic medications and other possible contributors where possible (eg lithium/ antidepressants and other psychotropics)
    + resuscitation (usually in ED/ ICU)
    1. respiratory support (oxygen ==> intubation/ ICU @required)
    2. cardiovascular support (bring down @++BP acutely with clonidine/ nitroprusside)
    3. temperature control (cool fluids, ice packs in the axilla, gastric lavage with cool fluids)
    4. medications (bromocriptine, dantrolene, benzodiazepines have evidence to support use)
    5. prevent other complications assoc with severe illness and long term hospital stay

# Serotonin syndrome
- @interaction of SSRIs, combined with MAOis/ lithium/ tryptophan
- classical triad
    + neurological
    + autonomic
    + mental state
- treatment
    + stop all psychotropic medication
    + supportive/ intubation
    + cryproheptidine if temperature >41.1


# ECT
- EEG monitoring to detemrine seizure duration, and stimulus dose titration (smallest possible dose of current to get symptomatic improvement)
- ECG monitoring
- sedation, muscle relaxation, fasting, cannot drink for 2 hours before. 
- indicated for sever major depression, mania, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder
- contraindciations
    + reaised intracranial pressure, brain tumor, cochlear implants (requires removal but this is difficult), hyperthyroidism, anaesthetic risks
- there is a cuff which prevents entry of hte muscle relaxant into the right leg - to detect seizure duration.
- clinicians step away when dose is being given. 
- side effects
    + confusion, amneisa, persistent memory disturbance, headache/ muscle aches, nausea
- Thymatron IV

- baseline EEG
EEG phases
- recruiting phase
    + low amplitude fast activity
- tonic phase
    + bilateral synchrnous (synchrony between left and right hemispheres)
- clonic phase
    + high amplitude, polyspike and underlying slow wave complexes
- postictal suppression
    + flattening out of the large waves

- hypotheses of mechanism
    + anticonvulsant hyptehsis
    + cerebral inhiibiotn
    + neurochemical hypotehsis
    + neuroendocrine hypothesis

# Other stimulating treatments
- TMS (transcranial magnetic stmiulation)
- DCS (direct current stimulation)
- MST (magnetic stimulation treatment)
- VNS (vagal nerve stimulation)
- DBS (deep brain stimulation) - most invasive

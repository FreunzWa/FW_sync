# Theory of Emotions, Feelings, Mood and Affect
- emotions
    + complex interrelation between visceral, body posture
- feelings
    + how your identity interacts with emotions
- mood
    + pervasive and sustained emotion which in the extreme markeledy colors the persons perception of the world
    + usually this is self-reported
- affect
    + an immediately expressed and observed emotion (the perceivable expression of the mood)
- "mood is to affect as climate is to weather"
    + the climate is stable but weather fluctuates on the background of that climate. that said, the mood is relatively stable, and the affect is a representation of that.

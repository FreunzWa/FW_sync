###### Alcohol withdrawal
- @prolonged AUD w/ excessive alcohol consumption == accumulation of alcohol in blood == tolerance and withdrawal symptoms @abrupt cessation.
- mx: @chronic alcohol exposure == neurons become relatively insensitive to GABA activation, thus requires constant presence of alcohol to maintain homeostasis. also alcohol also increases neurons sensitivity to glutamate @alcohol prevents glutamate binding.


## 4 Sydnromes of alcohol withdrawal
Minor withdrawal 
    Tremulousness, mild anxiety, headache, diaphoresis, palpitations, anorexia, gastrointestinal upset; normal mental status 
    6 to 36 hours 
Seizures 
    Single or brief flurry of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, short postictal period; status epilepticus rare 
    6 to 48 hours 
Alcoholic hallucinosis 
    Visual, auditory, and/or tactile hallucinations with intact orientation and normal vital signs 
    12 to 48 hours 
Delirium tremens 
    Delirium, agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, fever, diaphoresis 
    48 to 96 hours


--------------------------------------------------------------


# Minor withdrawal
- minor symptoms may still occur whilst there is an elevated BAC. these symptoms develop within 6-24 hours of last drink @alcohol dependedncee, but usu resolved within 24-48 hrs
- minor withdrawal symptoms (similar to short term symptoms of thyrotoxicosis)
    + insomnia
    + tremulousness
    + mild anxiety
    + GI upset, anorexia
    + headache
    + diaphoresis
    + palpitations

# seizure syndrome
- withdrawal seizures
    + withdrawal tonic clonic seizures (usu 12-48 hours after the last alcohol drink). usu @long history of chronic alcoholism. usu 12+ hours, but @severe dependence may even be a few hours of abstinence.
    + phenytoin is ineffecetive 
    + 1/3 of patients with seizure syndorme progress to DT


# Alcoholic hallucinosis 
* hallucinations that develop 12-24 hours of abstiencne, resolve in 24-48 hours. usu visual hallucainations, but %tactile/ auditory. patients are aware of hallucinations. 
* not necessarily DT at this stage (often confused with DT), and may have normal vital signs. @may occur within 24 hours at this time cannot be DT.
* resolve within 48 hours 



#  Delirium tremens (DT)
+ 5% of pt with withdrawal progress to DT
+ DT:
    * metnal (hallucinatins, disorientation) + dysautonomia (tachy, HTN, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, hyperventilation)
+ usu onset 48-96 hours after last drink, may last up to 5 days. 
+ not synonymous with alcoholic hallucinosis
    * alcoholic hallucinosis 
+ ABG shows respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation. 
+ hypovolaemic and hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia == ++seizures
+ hypophosphataemia @malnutrition
+ rf:
    * sustained drinking hx, hx of withdrawal seizures
    * history of DT, age >30
    * longer period since last drink. 
+ medical
    * natural history
        - death in DT can result from arrhythmia due to hyokalemia
    * cx

# Investigations/ Differential diagnosis
- important to rule out differentials eg perform LP/ CT scan (as the presentation may sometimes have fever/ altered mental status)
- also various mimickers can exist with alcoholic withdrawal, as this may have prompted the individual to stop drinking (eg meningitis, pancreatitis, GI bleeding, hepatic fialure)
- BAC
    + blood alcohol concentration - metric of alcohol intoxciation. %ethanol in the blood by units of mass of alcohol per volume. 
    + in victoria the legal driving limit is 0.05 -- this is 0.05% alcohol by mass. 
    + from 0.4-0.5 there is possibility of death. @0.5+ there is a high possibility of death


# Treating mild alcohol withdrawal
- benzos to treat psychomotor agitation



# Treating severe alcohol withdrawal
- electrolytes
    + correct K+/ phosphate/ magneisum deifficenc ies, glucose
    + fluid replacement
- vitamins
    + thiamine replacement immediately -- no risk in giving too much
    + multivitamins @assuming poor nutrition in geneeral
- alcohol withdrawal
    + IV benzos for psychomotor agitation (diaz, loraz) will prevent and ease psychomotor agitation
        * intramuscular should be avoided @unpredictable absorption


# Treating DT refractory to IV benzodiazepines
- barbiturates are used in synergy (esp phenobarbital) @they act syngergistically with benzos



- treat symptoms and correct electrolyte derangements. 
- alcohol withdrawal seizures
    + benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, propofol
    + do not use phenytoin

# Basics of psychiatry
- diagnosis requires a decline in function in the patients day to day life that is relevant to that individual
- all diagnoses are clinical; on history and collateral, the pathophysiology is basically non-existent - there are many unproven theories. further the knowledge about how treatemnts work is relatively unknown.

# History of psychiatry (L1 - Psychiatry)
/ most treatments were serendipity


- Nobel prize winners (Phys or Medicine):
    + 1920: deliberately infecting peopel with malaria (causing fever) which alleviates distress
    + 1950: lobotomy
    + (Sort of - in 2000):
- Eras:
    + up to 1900s, asylums used to isolate people with mental illness - irreversible incarceration effectively. worryingly also housed misfits. however, 1/3 of pt had tertiary syphilis - thus a biological cause for their mental illness
- Important time-points
    + 1920
    + 1930:
        * insulin coma therapy (initiate coma with hypoglycaemia)
        * ECT introduced in the late 1930s Italian sychiatrist theorise conbulsions ameliorate symptoms
    + 1940s:
        * lithium discovered for its use in mood stabilisation
        * first edition of DSM released
    + 1950: 
        * TCAs introduced
        * first generation antipsychotics available 
        * lobotomy introduced, but popularity waned in the late 1950s. 
    + 1960s:
        * MAOi
        * homosexuality removed from the DSM guidelines
        * known since the 60s that 70% of the efficacy is based on non-specific factors (like willingness to change, explanatory model that the therapist provides, a listening therapist, the patient feeling like they have been understood)
    + 1970: 
        * atypical antipsychotics introduced clinically
        * BDZ
    + 1980: 
        * SSRI
    + 1990:
        * SNRI
    + 2000:

# Basic history of treatments
Classes
- biologicals
    + medications
    + electrical
        * ECT
        * TMS

- Antipsychotics (Dopamine blockers)
    + These only treat positive symptoms of psychosis
    + Typical/First generation: first one Clorpromazine (first trialled as anaesthetic, but then repurposed as antipsychotics == calming)
        * all antipsychotics block dopamine, various receptors D1-4
        * just as good as the new ones, but poorly tolerated; only used @exhausted new ones, or old people (70% effective)
        * biggest side effects EPSE (tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity), Tardive dyskinesia (repetivie movements, irreversible)
    + 2nd generation: Atypical antipsyhcotics 
        * Better tolerated, just as effective
        * Olanzapine (weight gain), Quetiapine (QTc), Risperidone (prolactinaemia)
        * Clozapine (mild effect on negative, positive symptoms) - but can kill (agranulocytosis, cardiomyopathy)! Third line. 
        * No Tardive dyskinesia (much rarer)

- Antidepressants
    + Works on either serotonin/ noradrenaline in the CNS (there is one that works on melatonin but not subsidised nor used often)
    + all antidepressants pretty much work with same efficacy but difference is degree of tolerance.
    + TCAs:
        * anti-SLUDGE Side effects
        * lethal overdose (so not good for people who are suicidal?)
    + MAOis:
        * however requires dietary restriction
    + BDZ   
        * works within 20 minutes, decreases anxiety
        * strongly reinforcing, almost impossible to stop (fatal in withdrawal)
    + SSRIs:
        * not lethal in overdose, better tolerated
        * takes ~4 weeks to start working. 
        * usually also used in anxiety.
    + SNRIs:

- Mood stabilisers
    + Lithium for use in BPAD
    + Sodium valproate

# Electrical treatments
- ECT
    + initially without anaesthetic (physical injuries)
    + now M-ECT (modified with anaesthesia) which is theonly form in use today. 
    + now monitor EEG
    + predominantly used for severe melancolic depression, or severe mania in BPAD, treatment resistant schizophrenia 
    + given 3 times per week, usually 2-3 weeks for 6-8 treatments. 
    + remarkable results, and potentially underused.  
- Transcranial magnetic stimulation
    + only for use in private
    + poorly subsantiated, very weak effect.


# Clinical features of psychosis
- Positive symptoms
    + delusions
    + hallucinations
    + thoughts disroders
- Negative symptoms
    + affective blunting (cannot communicate emotion)

# Psychotherapy / Psychological treatments
- difficult to do double blind trials, and difficult to define the placebo condition, makes more difficult to research
- about 150 brands of psychotherapy, but main ones are:
    + psychoanalysis
        * idea is that unconscious conflict (id) causes conscious conflict (ego). 
        * practise of psychoanalysis is 3-5/ week for 3-5 years, theory of "talking cure" so that they gather insights into themselves. 
    + cogntivie behaviour therapy (CBT)
        * limited theory - effectively change way people think to change the way people behave, ultimately to change the way people feel. medicare fund 10 for psychologists to do, up to 20 sessions. 
- socratic questions
    + decrease belieavability of underlying thoughts (questioning negative automatic thinking)
- pleasant event scheduling

-----------------------------------------------------


# Approach to the psychiatry interview
- basic points
    + better to ask open questions (the classic image of the psychiatrist) and allow the patient to talk

### DSM classification of mental disorders
- DSM-V published in 2013
- contains some vague definitions for various mental illnesses, ICD potentially better.
- gender identity disorder (in the DSM because it requires heavy medication/ surgical intervention to treat), but with 98% satisfaction rate. but still under the heading of cosmetic surgery.
- schizophrenia - disturbance of thought with poor inter-episode function
- manic depressive insanity - disturbance of mood, but with good inter-episode function
- developed to increase the consistency of pyschiatric diagnosis

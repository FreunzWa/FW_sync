### Psychotic episode theory

# Medical
- psychotic episodes are either primary (caused by a psych disorder) or secondary (caused by a medical condition)

# Differentials
- primary causes
    + primary/ developmental schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder
- secondary causes
    + damage to brain (head trauma, tumor, bleed) 
    + drug induced
    + metabolic (hyperthermiea, thyrotoxicosis)
    + autoimmune (encpehalitis, porphyria)
    + infectious (bacterial or viral meningitis)

# Clinical
- Positive psychotic symptoms
    + Delusions
        * Fixed false beliefs that are not typical of cultural/ background. 
        * Must be differentiated from Obsessions - as these are resisted/ unwanted and ego-dystonic
        * Either bizarre/ non-bizarre
        * Primary delusions
            - Sudden, autocthonous delusion
            - Delusional atmosphere
            - Delusional perception
            - Delusional memory
        * Secondary delusions (delusion like idas)  
            - unlike primary they arise from other psychic event/s interactions with the world. 
            - form is closer to overvalued ideas
        * Types of delusions
            - Persecutory delusions (believing one is under threat from others)
            - Identity
                + Grandiose (elevated sense of wellbeing - eg. being a billionaire, having power over people)
            - Bodily delusions
                + Somatic/ Hypochondriacal (delusions about the body - eg believing sinus is infested)
            - Passionate
                + Entitlement
                + Jealousy
                + Erotomanic delusions (beliving a famous movie star is in love with them)
            - Delusions of reference (eg believing dialogue on TV is referring to them)
            - Delusions of control/ Passivisity phenomenon (beliving one's thoughts/ movements are being controlled by extenral force/ beings)
            - Affective-related
                + poverty, guilt, worthlessness, nihilism, failure
            - Mania-related
                + Talent, knowledge, power, identity
    + Hallucinations
        * sensory experience with absent stimuli (illusions, rather are misinterpretations of real sensory stimuli)
        * auditory most common, then visual, tactile, olfactory, gustatory
    + Thought disorganisation
        * identified @patients patterns of speech during the interview
        * types
            - alogia/ poverty content
            - thought blocking (suddenly losing train of thought)
            - loosening of association (ideas presented in sequence that are not closely related)
            - Tangentiality (answers to interview questions diverging increasingly from the topic being asked about, as opposed to cirumstantiality if eventually gets back to the topic)
- Negative psychotic symptoms
    + affective blunting
    + social withdrawal

###### Schizophrenia
- from the Greek "splitting of the mind". often misconstrued by teh public as being split personality disorder (a separate diagnosis)
- a remitting and relapsing illness with psychotic episodes
- almost certainly a neurodevelopmental disorder
- presents with positive and negative symptoms (positive = experience something 'extra' that you woudnt usually have, negative = when something is taken away). the negative symptoms usually develop after, in the later stages of the illness
    + this correlates with cortical atrophy (white and grey matter loss) -- ventriculomegaly
- generally less violent due to vulnerable state, but there are cases of ++violent serial killers

# Diagnostic criteria (DSM5)
- 1: 2+ of the following each present for significnat time during 1 month period. at least 1 must be 1,2,3
    + delusions
    + hallucinations
    + disorganised speech
    + grossly disorganised/ catatonic behaviour
    + negative symptoms 
- 2: functional impairment 
- 3: continuous signs of disturbance for at least 6 months. 
- 4: schizoaffective/ BPAD ruled out @no manic/ depressive episodes within the psychotic period
- 5: not caused by a drug
- 6: @ASD or communication disorder with childhood onset then schiz only diagnosed @psychotic sx >1 month

# Epidemiology
- 1% of population, this prevalence is extremly stable in records. stable across the world. -- evolutionary advantage?
- 2nd highest morbidity of any illness in the country, huge eocnomic burden due to loss of function
- risk factors
    + de novo changes in the developing brain (can be detected with brain changes as early as 7).
    + M=F, however M usu get early. average age of diagnosis is around 18. 
        * M (16-20 onset)
        * F (slightly later)
    + drug use: 
        * there is a clear link between psychotropic component of cannabis (THC) and schizophrenia. injection of THC == ~100% psychosis. howver CBD/THC balance == protects most peole from the psychotic effects of cannabis.
            - however @smoking ++cannabis earlier (especially THC)
            - smoking normal cannabis == very little risk (unless FHx of schizophrenia)
            - synthetic cannabis is worse (due to high proportion of THC)
        * stronger association with methamphetamine 
        * associated with anti-anxiety drugs (alcohol, smoking)
- 70% of people with schizophrenia smoke tobacco (stable)

# Classification
- schizophrenia
- treamtent resistant psychosis 
    + some patients may enter this group after a relapse (1/6 patients) and have a precipitious drop in fucntion
    + if totally treatment resistant, can use non-pharmacotherapy methods to control symptoms -- eg can use CBT/ psychosocial therapy/ treatment of co-morbid anxiety/ depression  
- clozapine sensitive schizophrenia
    + thought to produce -=dopamine opposed to excess dopamine of standard schizophrenia. 
- schizo-affective disorder
    + very rare disorder, on the spectrum between BPAD/ schizophrenia

# Medical
- degeneration: mx for cortical loss of grey and white matter related to the number of psychotic episodes (specifically the transition between normal and pssycohotic episodes) -- probably related to the burst of dopamine levels (neurotoxicity) 
    + this is similar to the mechanism for ice usage == dopamine burst.
- neurophysioogy: based on excess dopamine in the mesolimbic system (in the frontal lobe) which impairs cognition/ executive function
    + this is believed to be related to perception, as the frontal lobe manages how the perceptions are interpreted == thus for instance voices which would normally be thoughts are interpreted as truth 
- thought that puberty plays a role in development of schizophrenia
- prognosis
    + life expectancy: 50-60 (usu killed @cardiovascular disease @antipsychotics cause metabolic syndrome AND they don't care for themselves/ take medications). @no treatment == die even earlier (poor nutrition/ misadventure)


# Clinical
- presentation
    + positive psychotic symptoms (3)
        * delusions 
            - persecutory/ paranoia (the paranoia/ fear that people are out to get you)
            - usually formed by what is going on around you ()
        * hallucinations  ('perception without a stimulus')
            - 80%auditory, sounds like an external voice -- so important to ask does it sound like its coming through the ears or inside the head.
                + distinguish from pseudo-hallucinations - associated with Borderline personality disorder
            - %visual hallucinations, see something that appears absolutely real. 
                + if init present with visual hallucatinion then rule out drug abuse/ organic cause/ alcoholic withdrawal - much more likely
            - much rarer
                + gustatory hallucinations
                + haptic hallucinations
        * disorganised behaviour
            - thought disorder
    + negative pyschotic symptoms (assoc with chronic cortical atrophy)
        * loss of motiviation, self caring, spontaneity, -=cognition (similar with dementia loss of function)
        * actually less violent
        * catatonic schizophrenia
        * anosagnosia - thus do not present for treatment.
- First rank symptoms of schizophrenia (FRS) - Shneider
    + better @ruling out scz, but however nowadays mainly used as a description of a patient to corroborate diagnosis/ talk aboutseverity. 
    + DID patients also experience FRS, however they usually acknowledge that hte hallucinations are not real.
1. Audible thoughts - hearing one's thoughts spoken aloud
2. Somatic passivity - the feeling of being touched or strange unexplained sexual sensations
3. Thought insertion - the feeling an external force is putting thoughts into one's mind
4. Thought withdrawal - thoughts are withdrawn
5. Thought broadcasting - the feeling people can read one's mind
6. Made feelings - the feeling an external force is making you experience something
7. Made impulses - the feeling an external force is making you want something
8. Made volition - the feeling an external force is making you act a certain way
9. Voices arguing/discussing (often referring to the patient as "he" or "she")
10. Voices commenting - voices narrate one's actions as if giving a running commentary
11. Delusional percepts - a physical sensation (such as seeing or feeling something) that is interpreted as a very special event has happened and something important is realized


# Treatment
- due to lack of insight often require forced treatment @anosagnosia, backed by MHA to treat and hold people against will. however compliance very low (>70% do not take medication sufficiently) - depo injections
- ANTIPSYCHOTICS: @excess dopamine causes pathophysiology == block esp D2 receptors postsynaptically. however == block D2 motor pathway systems == motor dysfunction.
    + mesolimbic (blocks psychosis)
    + nigrostriatal (movement disorders manifested as parkinsonian symptoms)
    + tuburo-infundibular (prolactin release @dopamine usu suppresses prolactin == gynaecomastia/ galactorrhoea/ infertility/ -=libido/ osteoporosis/ ?breast cancer)
- the atypical antipsychotics are more selective
- antipsychotics available @PO or SC, PO has very low compliance, thus == DEPO SC injection, reuquires only 4 per year. (people on DEPO fair superiorly long term) - 15% currently in Australia treated with DEPO -- should increase usage of DEPO.
- cessation of antipsychotic medication == eventual relapse (thus need to take medications lifelong)
- prognosis with medical treatment
    + first usu see disappearance of positive symptoms of schizophrenia (-=irritabiltiy, improved sleep)
    + onset of action about 6 weeks, lower doses can be used @maintanenace therapy
    + the negative symptoms of schizophrenia do not treat eht negative symptos (except for clozapine, which has a mild efficacy)
    + %have no other episodes again, %have first/ second episodes/ lack of response to therapy (check for non adherenence and consider clozapine)
- options (antipsychotics)
    + clozapine (reserved for treatemnt resistant schiz, has a mild efficacy on negative symptoms. restricted @risk of death due to agranulocytosis and cardiomyopathy)

- Electrical therapy
    + ECT rarely used, for extremely treatment resistant cases. even if there is mild improvement it is unlikely to last. 
    + another problem is that the patient has to be relatively compliant.

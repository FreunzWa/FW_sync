###### Acute psychosis

# Differentials
- primary causes
    + primary/ developmental schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder
- secondary causes
    + damage to brain (head trauma, tumor, bleed) 
    + drug induced
    + metabolic (hyperthermiea, thyrotoxicosis)
    + autoimmune (encpehalitis, porphyria)
    + infectious (bacterial or viral meningitis, HIV)

# Initial assessment
- history
- determine if this is first episode pyschosis, or recurrent psychotic episode
    + @initial psychosis must rule out other organic causes and BPAD @often similar presentation to schizophrenia, @BPAD with psychotic features


# Investigations
- rule out orgnaic cause with CTs/ bloods/ LP/ TSH/ blood culture

# Management
- initial
    + risk assessment
        * evaluated for risk of harm to self/ others
    + risk reduction    
        * @agitated patient == use 1st generation antipsychotic rapidly acting sedating (levomapromazine) +/-/or benzodiazepine. 
    + treat any underlying medical condition
    + obtain a temporary treatment order if necessary if the patient is unable to consent for treatment/ refusing treatment at the risk of others
- medications
    + antipsychotic

---------------------------------------------------------

# Treatment algorithm for first episode of psychosis
1. exclude organic cause
2. initial medication free period of at least 48 hours
3. FIRST LINE TREATMENT
- Low dose of atypical antipsychotic
    + Olanzapine, Risperidone, Aripiprazole, Quetiapine, Ziprasidone, Amisulpride
4. Review in 2-4 weeks
- @good response, continue the medication for 12 months, then withdraw gradually after this with careful monitoring (usu about 3-6 months)
- @inadequate reponse, increase dose. continue for at least 3-6 weeks
5. @still inadequate response, alternative atypical and consider augmentation (with Valproate, Lithium) in a schizoaffective presentation. Review in 6-8 weeks.
6. @still inadequate response, then try cloazpine or typical agent

# Treatment allgorithm for relapse schizophrenia
- DEPOT if adherence is a problem
- use a typical antispsychotic only if it has been used in teh past before with good rspones
- otherwise use atypical
- if still resistant, then go cloazpine

---------------------------------------------------------------
# treatment resistant schizophrenia
- @two failed treatment tirlas with antipsychotics from two different  classes. (failure of resolution of positive psychotic symptoms)
- in the approach to treatemnt resistant schiz, focus on:
    + clozapine
    + augmentation strategies (typically when there is still limited response to even clozapine)

###### Fractures

# Growth Plate Fractures (Saltar-Harris Fractures)
- @paed fracture involves physis (i.e. fracture end goes through physis) == require ortho @else == chronic deformity/ malalignment/ growth issues.
- follow up usu for =>1 year following a SH fracture
- Grading system
    + Saltar Harris fracture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SalterHarris.svg) for a nice illustration of the first 5 types. There are 9 types in total.
        * "SALTER" mnemonic
        * G1: "Slip" - shear fracture == separation
        * G2: "Above" - # above the physis {75%, the most common}
        * G3: "Lower" - # below the physis
        * G4: "Through Everything/All" - # through meta/physis/epiphysis
        * G5: "Rammed" - Physis crushed (uncommon)

# Boxer's Fracture
- # distal 5th metacarpal @high impact blow, usu @punching hard object (-=%4th MC)/, ++ @M
- depressed knuckle + pain, confirm @plain film (CT == ++SN)
- @<70 degrees of angulation == tensor bandage sufficient, else splinting. (surgery @++displaced)
- common, 1/5 of all hand #s. 
- outcomes good, but knuckle usu somewhat deformed @malalignment == curved 5th MC (can see on plain film chronically), healing limited to 12 weeks.

# Galeazzi Fracture
- #Radius, dislocation of Ulna (both distal, but have heard people call it thus in proximal cases)

# Monteggia Fracture
- #Distal ulna, fracture radius (PS same as above)


# Colle's Fracture
- complete transverse distal radius # == dorsal angulation and deformity usu @FOOSH
- %ulna styloid fracture + radial ulnar articulation disturbance


# Hill-Sachs Deformity
- cortical depression @posterolateral head of humerus @antero-inferior dislocation == impaction against glenoid == humeral head fracture
- diagnose @plain lateral and AP views

# Bankart lesion (deformity)
- humeral head dislocated == impaction @anterior glenoid labrum ridge == fracture. %accompanied with hill sachs

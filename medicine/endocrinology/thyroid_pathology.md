###### Thyroid pathology

# Overt hyperthyroidism
- basics
    + biochemical: low TSH with high T3/4, with features suggestive clinically of hyperthyroidism
- clinical
    + presentation
        * heat intolerance
        * palpitations (SVT/ AF)
        * diarrhoea
        * unexplained weight loss/ ++appetite
        * hyperhidrosis
        * menstrual dysfunction
        * gynaecomastia
        * anxiety/ insomnia
        * features of heart failure (esp @old)/ dyspnoea/ SOA
- medical
    + mx
        * T3/4 == ++expression of beta receptors == symptoms of SANS activity chronically.
    + cx
        * BMD loss @T3/4 cause bone mineral resorption == ++risk of fracture
        * ++risk of AF (thromboembolic risk)
- investigations
    + TFTs
        * best initial test is TSH, but can combine init with T3/4
    + FBE
        * normochromic normocytic anaemia (@++plasma volume)
    + BMD
        * thyrotoxicosis causes bone resorption == ++risk of fractures
    + lipid studies may be lower than otherwise
- rx
    + pharma
        * symptomatic relief   
            - beta-agonists (eg propranolol, or atenolol/metoprolol @relative CI to b2 antag)
                + relieve palps, tremor, anxiety, heat intolerance by blocking the ++number of beta-receptors
                + also reduces T3 levels in serum as it inhibits conversion of T4 ==> T3. does not really contribute to the therapeutic effect of the medication
        * reduced T3/4 production
            - Methimazole
                + converted into carbimazole. dose determined @degree of T4 elevation (multiples of normal)
            - PTU 
                + not used as much @hepatotoxicity concerns, does not achieve euthyroid as fast, reduces success of RAI therapy, poor compliance, multiple doses per day
            - block and replace therapy very rarely used.

# Subclinical hyperthyroidism
- basics
    + biochemical definition with a low TSH but normal T3/4
    + use biochemical findings @the symptoms of thyrotoxicosis may be non specific
- diagnosis
    + made on biochemical testing alone.
    + the TFTs should be repeated along with T3/4 to make the diagnosis. 1-3 months to confirm diagnosis.
- differentials
    + central hypothyroidism (@-=release of TRH/TSH from pit)
    + medications (dopamine/ high dose GCs) may reduce TSH
    + recovery from hyperthyroidism
    + African descent individuals may have lower TSH by default 
- medical 
    + etiology
        * exogenous
            - excessive THR (exogenous subclinical hypertyroidism)
        * endogenous
            - thyroid adenomas/ multinodular goitres are the most common causes. %Graves' disease (clinically euthyroid Graves' disease)
    + cx/ nat history
        * progression to overt hyperthyroidism (up to 8% rate of progression per year.) may also %resolve naturally.
        * bone mineral disease (as T3/4 directly stimulate bone resorption, increased risk of fracture). prev known overt hyperthyroidism causes ++fractures.
        * may mildly increase dementia risk
- clinical
    + presentation
        * %asymptomatic
        * %features of thyrotoxicosis, but mild and non-specific.
- investigations
    + repeat TFTs with T3/4 levels.
    + Thyroid autoantibodies
    + RAI uptake scan (looking for autonomously functioning thyroid nodule/ adenoma/ Graves' )
    + USS
- rx
    + decision to manage based on patient symptoms/ persistently low TSH levels/ autonomous nodules on RAIUS
        * pharma rx smilar to overt
    + observation
        * decision to observe @patient TSH 0.1-0.5, asymptomatic. repeat TFTs every 6 months.

###### Endocrinological emergencies

# Addisonian crisis (adrenal crisis)
- basics
    + acute adrenal insufficiency ^clinical sx @cortisol insufficiency == acute syndrome
- clinical
    + presentation
        * sudden penetrating pain in legs/ abdomen/ back
        * vomiting/ diarrhoea
        * syncope
        * hypotension/ hypoglycaemia @low cortisol
        * confusion /psychoses/ delirium/ slurred speech
        * lethargy
        * hyponatremia @salt wasting @loss MC  effect ^hyperkalemia + MA, hypercalcemia
        * seizures/ fever
- medical
    + etiologies
        * addisons' disease (gradual loss cortisol release followed by acute decompensation), CAH
        * excessive corticosteroid use/ cortisol replacement followed by rapid withdrawal 
        * insufficient cortisol release @very stressful circumstances (eg surgery/ infection/ mental stress/ trauma)
        * hypopituitarism (usu @acute cause eg pituitary apoplexy)
        * acute adrenal hemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)

# Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome (hemorrhagic adrenalitis)
- basics
    + acute adrenal gland failure @acute hemorrhage usu @neisseria meningitidis, usu bilaterally @underlying meningoccemia, DIC, high mortality.
- medical
    + causative organisms
        * N meningitidis most common
        * P aeruginosa
        * Strep pneumo sepsis
        * TB @invasion into adrenals
        * Staph aureus esp @paeds
- clinical
    + presentation
        * features associated with underlying sepsis, macular rash, septic shock sx.


# Thyroid storm
- basics
    + rare, emergency, @severe manifestations of overt thyrotoxicosis. ~15% IP with thyrotoxicosis get thyroid storm. assoc with high mortality of up to 30%, requires intesnive care.
    + %assoc with triggers
- medical
    + mx
        * thought to be @sudden rapid release of T3/T4 into serum, though T3/4 serum levels which are released are not necessarily higher than standard chronic hyperthyroidism
    + etiologies
        * triggers include surgery, truama, infection, acute iodine load, parturition, irregular use or sudden interruption to antithyroid medications
        * may develop @prexisting untreated hyperthyroidism
        * most common cause @hyperthyroid patient having surgery (better prophylaxis has decreased rates)
- clinical
    + rf
        * 
    + presentation
        * exaggerated sx of hyperthyroidism (severe tachy, CCF, hypotension, diarrhoea, death from CV failure). cardiac sx seem to predominate. 
        * hyperpyrexia, often over 40 degrees
        * mental status changes can be used to differentiate thyroid storm from thyrotoxicosis (eg agitation, delirium, psychosis, stupor, coma)
- ix
    + TFT
        * low TSH and high serum T3/4. usu not more profound that in uncomplicated thyrotoxicosis. 
    + bloods
        * mild hyperglycaemia (@catecholamine induced glucose production and inhibition of glucose release), abnormal LFTs, leukocytosis, leukopaenia. 
- diagnosis
    + made @patient with severe sx (hyperpyrexia, cardiovascular sx, alterred mentation) @patient with abn TFTs (elevated T3/4 + TSH drop)
- rx
    + pharmacology
        * beta blocker to control sx @++adrenergic tone (usu propranolol)
        * thionamide to block new T3/4 production (PTU or methimazle, PTU better @also stops T4 == T3)
        * iodine solution to block release of TH
        * GCs (reduction of T4 == T3 conversion)
        * bile acid sequestrants (may stop enterohepatic recycling of THs)
    + long term 
        * @pt with Graves disease should use radioactive ablation/ surgery (ablation better tolerated @risk of recurrence @surgery)
        * surgery better @large goitre


# Serotonin syndrome (SS)
- basics
    + emergency @++serotonin in the CNS. 
    + classically described as triad of mental status changes, autonomic hyperactivity, neuromuscular abn.
    + usu caused @medication use, interactions between drugs, overdose, MDMA
    + most commonly @SSRIs, MDMA, MAOi
    + must distinguish from mild side effects associated with SSRI use which may produce milder clinical findings but still showing a serotonin excess. pt may still benefit from taking the drug @side effects tolerable.
    + has various cx which can be life threatening.
- clinical features
    + mental status changes (anxiety, agitaiton, disoritentation)
    + autonomic (diaphoresis, flushing, hypertehrmia, hypertension, vomiting, diarrhoea)
    + neuromuscular (muscle rigidty, tremor, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, upgoing plantar reflex bil)
    + history points
        * take detailed medication history (recent chagnes to dose, use routine, OTCs, illicit substances)
        * develops within 24 hrs
- medical
    + mx
        * hytperthermia @increased muscular activity/rigidity can cuase severe hyperpyrexia
    + ++@medications causing ++serotonin activitiy
        * MDMA
            - causes increased serotonin released from synapse
        * MAOi
            - decreased MAO mediated breakdown of monoamines == ++serotonin production. MAOis are irreversible @irreversible bind to MAO
            - MAOis have so many drug reactions. 
            - have worse outcomes if these are the cause of serotonin syndrome
        * SSRIs
    + complications
        * DIC, rhabdo, metabolic acidoiss, seizures, AKI/ renal failure
- diagnosis
    + clinically
    + differentials
        * neuroleptic malignant sydnrome (often misdiagnosed)
            - takes longer to develop, days to weeks.
            - neuromuscular features are opposite, sluggishness as opposed to hyperreflexia and rigidity.
        * anticholinergic toxicity
        * malignnat hyperpyrexia
            - anaesthetic exxposure
        * meningitis/ encephalitis
- rx
    + principles of rx
        * discontinue all serotonin afgents
        * normalise vital signs (treat hyertension, hyperthermia)
        * sedation with benzos
        * administration of sertononin antagonists
        * ongoing assessment if can reintroduce serotoninergic agents
    + most patients fine @discontinue serotonin meds and give benzos + supportive care
    + @more severe features eg. autonomic instability/ severe hypertension == may require sertonin antagonists. 
    + @life threaetening eg body temp >41, may require muscular relaxation and intubation
    + important to determine drug cause, MAOis last the longest, others usu resolve <24 hrs.
    + treatment of features:
        * hypertension/ tachycardia
            - nitroprusside/ esmolol to bring BP down
        * @hypotensin, esp caused @MAOis
            - vasopressors (NAdr)
        * hyperthermia
            - @>41.1 require ikmmediate paralysis, sedation, intubation w/ RSI, ICU
        * antidote: 
            - Cyproheptadine used @first line therapy fails. 12 mg initially, 2mg every 2 hours until clinical repsonse. only oral, but can give @NGT.

###### Menstrual cycle physiology
- can be described either as the ovarian cycle or the uterine cycle, both with three phases.

# Ovarian cycle
- follicular phase
    + the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle, FSH release == maturation of a few follicles, one becomes dominant (Graafian follicle, containing the Ovum). takes up to 12 days to mature. 
    + at this level of E2, LH/ FSH release from teh anterior pituitary is suppressed.
- ovulation
    + the Graafian follicle releases ++E2 == effect of LH suppression is reversed == causes ovarian rupture == LH surge. starts at day 12 of the cycle 
    + the rupturing processs may take 48 hours. 
    + the ovum is swept into the fallopian tubes
- luteal phase
    + FSH and LH cause the remannts of the egg to transform into the corpus luteum == which produces progesterone. 
    + progesterone increase the production of E2. 
    + progesterone suppresses FSH and LH (which would otherwise maintaint the corpus luteum) == corpus atrophies. 
    + thus the progesterone falls. (usually 14 days after ovulation)
    + however if the egg is fertilized, it is maintained and starts to produced bHCG which is just like LH and maintains the CL, allowing it to produced PG to maintaint the pregnancy (as it will increase E2 to allow implantation)


# Contraceptive pills
- mechanism: progesterone decreased GnRH mediated FSH/ LH release, preventing development of the follicle. 
- combined oral contraceptive pill: added estrogen @stabilises the endometrium. 
- progesterone only 
- risk of VTE increased @estrogen increases factor 7,8,10, fibrinogen and plasminogen.

###### Thyroid investigations

### Investigations
    TFTs
    Autoimmune panel + ESR
    Thyroid ultrasound + Doppler
    RAI uptake scan
    CT/ MRI 
    Test for differentials

### TFTs
-----------------------------------
# Screening for thyroid dysfunction
- screening for patients @risk with thyroid disease (eg family history/ past irradiation, on amiodarone etc.)
- for screening, to minimise cost routinely TSH is the only thing that is measured, and if there is abnormal == include T4 if TSH low. if TSH high get T3/4 levels.

# Monitoring levothyroxine therapy
- indciations
    + common cause to take TFTs @TRT due to hypothyroidism.
    + must stop subclinical hyperthyroidism @this increases the risk of bone disese/ AF. thus should screen even @asymptomatic
    + T4 may be used in cases of central hypothyroidism (secondary) w/ impaired TSH release. monitor T4, maintain in upper 50% of normal range. 
    + TSH is also taken for follow up for thyroid cancer (in patients with subtotal resection). 
- monitoring
    + serum TSH is used, @high == the dose needs to be increased, if too low == lowered dose necessary. 

- T4 is an insensitive way to monitor for resonse so is not used. 

# Initial bloods in suspected thyroid pathology from history / examination
- thyroid lab investigations start with lab test for TSH and Free-T4. 
- %also include T3/ and total T3/T4 tests
- TSH 
    + normal range 0.4-5 mU/L (there is some controversy aboout upper cutoff value, %believe 2.5 better)
- Free-T4
    + 99.9% T4 bound to TBG/ TBPA
    + the unbound portion is freely available to bind to nuclear receptors/ uptake into cells.  

# Confounding factors
- TSH/T4/T3 changes can occur @nonthyroidal illnesses.

# TFT interpretation
- low TSH with a normal T3/4 is subclinical hyperthyroidism, or a high TSH with normal T3/4 is subclinical hypothyroidism
    + both biochemical definitions @clinical findings of thyroid pathology are non-specific

###### Thyroid investigations

### Investigations
    TFTs
    Autoimmune panel + ESR
    Thyroid ultrasound + Doppler
    RAI uptake scan
    CT/ MRI 
    Test for differentials

### TFTs
-----------------------------------
# Screening for thyroid dysfunction
- screening for patients @risk with thyroid disease (eg family history/ past irradiation, on amiodarone etc.)
- for screening, to minimise cost routinely TSH is the only thing that is measured, and if there is abnormal == include T4 if TSH low. if TSH high get T3/4 levels.

# Monitoring levothyroxine therapy
- indciations
    + common cause to take TFTs @TRT due to hypothyroidism.
    + must stop subclinical hyperthyroidism @this increases the risk of bone disese/ AF. thus should screen even @asymptomatic
    + T4 may be used in cases of central hypothyroidism (secondary) w/ impaired TSH release. monitor T4, maintain in upper 50% of normal range. 
    + TSH is also taken for follow up for thyroid cancer (in patients with subtotal resection). 
- monitoring
    + serum TSH is used, @high == the dose needs to be increased, if too low == lowered dose necessary. 

- T4 is an insensitive way to monitor for resonse so is not used. 

# Initial bloods in suspected thyroid pathology from history / examination
- thyroid lab investigations start with lab test for TSH and Free-T4. 
- %also include T3/ and total T3/T4 tests
- TSH 
    + normal range 0.4-5 mU/L (there is some controversy aboout upper cutoff value, %believe 2.5 better)
- Free-T4
    + 99.9% T4 bound to TBG/ TBPA
    + the unbound portion is freely available to bind to nuclear receptors/ uptake into cells.  

# Confounding factors
- TSH/T4/T3 changes can occur @nonthyroidal illnesses.

# TFT interpretation
- low TSH with a normal T3/4 is subclinical hyperthyroidism, or a high TSH with normal T3/4 is subclinical hypothyroidism
    + both biochemical definitions @clinical findings of thyroid pathology are non-specific

# thyroid imaging
- similar to BI-RADS for breast imaging
- TI-RADS (old systems)
    + risk stratification system for classifying thyroid lesions (similar to BI-RADs for breast lesions)
    + classification
        * TI-RADS 1: normal
        * TI-RADS 2: benign lesions
        * TI-RADS 3: probably benign lesions
        * TI-RADS 4: suspicious lesions (4a,b,c in increasing malignancy)
        * TI-RADS 5: probably malignant (80%+ likely)
        * TI-RADS 6: proven (biopsy shows malignancy)
- ACR TI-RADS (updated system). based on ultrasound features. get a score, and this detemrines whether should FNA
    + composition 
        * mixed cystic and solid (1 point)
        * all solid (2 points)
    + echogenecitiy
        * anechoic (0 points)
        * hyper/ iso-echoic (1 point)
        * hypoechoic (2 points)
        * very hypoechoic (3 points)
    + shape
        * taller than wide on travnsverse plane (3 points)
    + margin
        * lobulated/ irregular (2 points)
        * extra-thyroidal extension (3 points)
    + other features
        * punctate echogenic foci (3 points)
        * macrocalcficiations (1 point)
        * peripheral/ rim calcications (2 points)
    + score:
        * 0
        * 2
        * 3 (should follow up)
        * 4-6
        * 7

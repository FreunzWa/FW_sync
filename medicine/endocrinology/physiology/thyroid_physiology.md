###### Thyroid physiology

# Anatomy
- two lobes connected @midline isthmus. posteriorly located parathyroid glands embedded. 
- tissue comprised of thyroid follicles, filled with internal colloid

# Thyroid hormone production
- Na+/ I- symporter transports 2 Na+ ions with one I- ion into the follicle cell (Na+ down conc gradient to move I- up concentration gradient)
-  I- moved into collolid by luminal pendrin transporter
-  TPO oxidises I- to form I2 (Iodide)
-  TPO then iodinates the tyrosyl residudes of the Tg within colloid (Tg is produced in ER of follicle cell and secreted into colloid)
-  TRH (pituitary) == TSH release == endocytosis of colloid
-  endocytosed vesicles containing iodinated Tg fuse with lysosomes of the follicular cell. 
-  iodinated residues 
- membrane trasnport
- Tg cleaved off to form T3/T4
-  MCT (monocarboxylate transporter) transports the T3/T4 across the basolateral surface and into the blood stream. 

# Thyroid hormone in serum
- T4:T3 approximately 14:1
- T4 is a prohormone, converted into T3 @intracellular conversion with deiodinases. (can also convert it into rT3, which is not bioactive) 
- transport
    + ++% of thyroid hormone bound to serum binding proteins
        * TBG (70%)
        * some is also bound to TSH, TBPA
- membrane trasnport
    + thyroid hormone is transported intracellularly @active ATP-dependent transport (despite being lipophilic)
    
# Thyroid hormone receptors
- THRs are intracellular receptors bound to co-repressor. @T3 binding to THRs == corepressors are displaced == recruitment of co-activator proteins == gene transcription of the thyroid response elements.

# Physiological effects of thyroid 
- cardiac
    + increased CO, HR
- resp
    + increased ventilatory rate
- increases basal metabolic rate (++energy consumption/ ++thermogenesis)
- potentiates activity of catecholamines (heightening systemic SANS effect)
- increased catabolism of proteins/ carbohydrates.

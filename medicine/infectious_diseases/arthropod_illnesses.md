# Approach to insect bite

-----------------------------------------------------------
### Infestations
# Scabies infestation
- basics
    + sarcoptes scabiei, transmitted @physical contact @poor survival away from host.
    + 1 mnth life cycle. even @widespread rash usu <100 mites at any given time. enzymatic dissolution of skin, then consumes the skin products. 
- medical
    + cx
        * pruritis may persist for weeks-months even after eradication w/ treatment.
- clinical
    + rf
        * exposure history (enquire as to contacts)
    + presentation
        * onset of rash 3-4 weeks @development of allergic reaction @1st infestation. @prev history of infestation, rash begins @1-2 days.
        * intensely itchy rash, worse @night. %pruritis precedes rash. 
        * %@children face/ palms involved, %with pustules/ papules
    + appearance of skin lesion
        * wavy line w/ small vesicle at one end (use dermatoscope to visualise the mite). ++@wrists, hands, sides o fingers/ %ankles.
        * genitalia nodules (++pruritic)
- examination
    + esp examine sides of feet, hands, nipples, umbilicus, gentialia.
- dx
    + scrape end of burrow, glass slide w/ fixative, visualise the mite/ egg
- treat
    + treat all contacts/ bed linen (in washing machine). anything cannot be washed put in plastic bags for 3 days. 
    + pharma
        * permethrin 5% - 2 treatments 1 week apart. (cream neck down, whole body ++@under nails, fingers). often 1 treatment sufficient
        * sulphur 5-10%. better in pregnant/ infants. 
        * ivermectin (PO) 
        * benzyl benzoate (25% daily for 3 days, but burning sensation == not used)
        
# Norwegian scabies
- basics
    + variant of scabies with 1000s mites, highly infectious
    + erythematous, scaley, crusts on hands/ feets w/ debris under nails. similar to dermatitis like eruption
    + usu @modified host reponse to the mite (@immunosuppression/ dementia)
    + %not as itchy
    + often seen @nursey homes == outbreak of scabies

# Lice
- basics   
    + head lice/ pubic lice/ body lice
    + body lice live in clothes, only visit host to feed, esp @person with poor hygiene not changing clothes
    + pubic lice (looser hair), %see at other loose hair locations (axilla, eyebrows). 60% infected @2 sites, screen for other STIs
    + head lice are becoming +=resistant to treatment
    + feeds on host every 4-6 hours. 10 eggs/ day (hatches at 7 days), cemented to hair. lives 1 month. lives <36 hrs away from host. 
- clinical
    + presentation
        * intense pruritis of scalp, first infestation pruritis onset 2-6 weeks.
        * esp @occiput. visualise nits (eggs)
        * eggs do not move along hair, unlike seborrhoeic dermatitis. unhatched, grey area. 
- treatment
    + important to repeat non-ovicial treatment after 10 days.
    + permethrin 10% cream rinse, leave on for 10 minutes.
        * not ovicidal
    + benzyl alcohol lotion (5% for 20 minutes)
        * not ovidical
    + maldison
        * ovicidal
    + ivermectin a last resort @fail toical therapy.
    + physical removal of lice w/ wet combing. 
    + clothing/ linen washed, otherwise plastic bag for 2 weeks.

# Pubic lice
- permethrin cream 5% overnight repeat 1 week, % use maldison
- ivermectin @fail first treatment
- physical removal of eggs

# Body lice
- basics
    + esp @poor hygiene/ overcrowding, cannot change clothes
    + can survive up to 10 days outisde body.
- clinical
    + presentation
        * rash localised around clothing seam (esp eggs)
- diagnose
    + check clothing seams, visualise eggs


###### Arthropod bites
- basics
    + most reactions are allergic, 1st time bitten no reaction, eventually @repeat exposure == no reaction.
- clinical
    + presentation 
        * immediate: urticarial wheal resolves < days.
        * delayed: at 24 hours firm pruritic papule, lasts for days-weeks
        * exaggerated bite reaction (eg necrotic), query CLL/ EBV infection

# Fleas
- basics
    + cat flea most common, dog/bird/rat
    + fleas can stay in cocoon for up to 1 year, staying dormant. (eg unoccupied houses). move into light and jump @shadow.
    + eggs usually fall off into environment.
- clinical
    + papular urticaria, esp @lower legs, %blister formation
- diagnosis
    + pet taken to VET, shake out bedding to visualise flea eggs, faeces.
- treat
    + animal treated @vet, %house will require treatment w/fumigations (methoprene) 

# Bed-bugs
- basics
    + 5 mm long, wingless, blood sucking
    + hide in cracks in furniture. spread to new houses @backpacks/ clothes/ furniture
    + feed for 3-12 minutes, host cannot feel. can live up to 1 year without feeding.
- medical
    + cx
        * can cause anaemia @chronic exposure.
- clinical
    + presentation
        * lesion esp @skin exposed areas
        * sensitized: purpuric macule
        * @sensitized: wheal/ macule with central hemorrhagic punctum
        * characteristic sickly sweet smell, blood spot on the bedding.
- treat
    + difficult to eradicate, requires professional fumigation

# Animal scabies (mange)
- basics
    + self limiting infestation of humans <2 weeks. infects animals, requiring VET treatment

# Cheyletiella
- basics
    + high contagious between animals. resolves spontaneously within humans @cannot live on humans, requires the animal to be treated first.

# Bird mites
- basics
    + affects birds
    + congregate within house in warm areas, %bite humans but cannot live on humans. similar rash to flea bites
    + clean out any bird nests in roof etc.

# Chigger mites
- basics
    + feed on humans for a few days, then drop off
    + can transmit scrub typhus
        * scrub typhus == rash, rickettsial severe systemic illnesses %with multi organ involvement.
    + at bite site: eschar 
- presentation
    + faint widespread rash
    + eschar @the site of the bite.
-----------------------------------------------------------

# Delusions of parasitosis
- matchbox signs
    + bring in a bag that is filled with bits of skin/ lint etc that they believe represent the parasites
- actually %contagious, close contacts may become to believe it as well. 
- may respond well to antipsychotics.

# Morgellons disease
- presence of fibres underneath the skin, %@patient self-embedding fibres.

# Lyme disease (aka borreliosis)
- basics
    + tick borne spirochete Borreliella burgdorferi w/ various species @country. transmitted @ixodes ticks only.
    + only transmitted @tick bite, no human-human
    + generalised illness that starts with a local macular lesion, but can progress to involve nervous system/ cardiac
    + at risk countries: North hemisphere temperate regions (North Africa, North Asian countries esp Japan, Northern Europe, UK, North-East America)
- medical
    + associated
        * may be associated with co-transmission of anaplasmosis
    + cx
        * see neurology section for 'Nervous system lyme disease and Bannwarth syndrome etc.'
- clinical
    + presentation (classical 3 phases)
        * early localised (<1/12 after bite)
            - classic erythema migrans (EM) skin lesion 1 mnth after tick bite at site of bite.  targetoid central sparing w/ surrounding erythema
            - usu constitutional sx that mimic viral infx, fatigue/ headache
        * early disseminated (weeks-months after initial EM)
            - multiple EM lesions
            - %pts do not have antecedent early localised phase
            - %neurologic/ cardiac involvement
                + lyme cardiitis/ facial nerve palsy/ radiculopathy (Bannwarth syndrome)/ %ocular diseaes
        * late disease (months-years after initial infection)
            - %first features occur here
            - intermittent/ persistent oligo-arthritis of large joints (esp knee) {%PC}/ %joint effusion
            - %migratory polyarthalgias
            - %worsening polyneuropathy, %subtle encephalopathy, %cardiac involvement.
    + other notes on presentation
        * severity/ each feature varies @lcation @different causative species
        * URTI/ GI sx not associated w/ lyme disease == consider viral infx
        * fatigue /non specific sx common in all phases
    + history
        * focus on travel/ activity hx/ tick bites
    + exam 
        * look for EM
- investigate
    + spirochetemia tests not available
    + serology: 
        * IgG/ IgM tests only positive in the late stage (when arthritis or other late features). 
        * @have EM rash, treat immediately, serology will not change rx @++negative.
- treat
    + Secondary prevention
        * @pt recognises tick bite == immediate commence doxycycline for prophylaxis
    + Abx (commence @EM)
        * 1 of (doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime). Doxy usu used @good @treating common con-infections. duration 21 days.
    + prognosis: 
        * even @spirochetes like syphilis, no damage to fetus @treatment. not transmitted @breast feeding/ vaginal/ sexually
        *   %==fibromyalgia, %progress to chronic lyme disease, %post lyme syndrome

# Ehrlichiosis
- basics
    + rickettsial parasite spread @lone star tick - Ixodes - throughout eastern USA./ mexico
    + often misdiagnosed as anasplasmosis, however as treatments are the same this should not impact patient outcomes.
- medical
    + associated
        * %cotransmitted with babesiosis/ borrelia
    + cx
        * %%DIC == multi organ failure
- clinical
    + presentation
        * similar to anaplasmosis
        * %develop a patechial rash
- investigate
    + PCR test for rapid diagnosis
- treat
    + doxycycline (start before lab results return)

# Anaplasmosis
- basics
    + rickettsial parasite 
    + prev known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis
    + transmitted by the lone star tick - an Ixodes tick, thus distributed throughout eastern USA/ mexico
- medical
    + %%DIC == multi organ failure 
- clinical
    + presentation (similar to ehrlichiosis)
        * %asympatomatic
        * 10% see EM rash @%cotransmitted with Lyme disease/ babesiois
        * tachycardia (@anaemia)
        * non specific B sx: fever, chills, myalgia, weakness, N/V, headache. usu onset 12 days after bite
- treat
    + prevention
        * a vaccine is now available
    + abx
        * doxycycline (start before lab results return)
- investigate
    + PCR of serum: 
    + serology not as SP/ SN as PCR
    + blood smear: cytoplasmic inclusions with visualisation of morula within neutrophils


# Mosquito borne
    Dengue
    Zika
    Chikungunya
    Malaria

# Yellow fever
- basics
    + disrtribution 

# Chikungunya fever (CF)
- basics
    + mosquito born alphavirus == acute febrile polyarthralgia/ arthritis. 
    + etymology == "stooped walk" @incapacitating arthalgia
    + endemic west africa, 35-50% population have +ve antibodies to the CV in some areas

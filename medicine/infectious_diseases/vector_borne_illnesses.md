# Lyme disease (aka borreliosis)
- basics
    + tick borne spirochete Borreliella burgdorferi w/ various species @country. transmitted @ixodes ticks only.
    + only transmitted @tick bite, no human-human
    + generalised illness that starts with a local macular lesion, but can progress to involve nervous system/ cardiac
    + at risk countries: North hemisphere temperate regions (Northern Africa, North Asian countries esp Japan, Northern Europe, UK, North America)
- medical
    + cx
        * see neurology section for 'Nervous system lyme disease and Bannwarth syndrome etc.'
- clinical
    + presentation (classical 3 phases)
        * early localised (<1/12 after bite)
            - classic erythema migrans (EM) skin lesion 1 mnth after tick bite at site of bite.  targetoid central sparing w/ surrounding erythema
            - usu constitutional sx that mimic viral infx, fatigue/ headache
        * early disseminated (weeks-months after initial EM)
            - multiple EM lesions
            - %pts do not have antecedent early localised phase
            - %neurologic/ cardiac involvement
                + lyme cardiitis/ facial nerve palsy/ radiculopathy (Bannwarth syndrome)/ %ocular diseaes
        * late disease (months-years after initial infection)
            - %first features occur here
            - intermittent/ persistent oligo-arthritis of large joints (esp knee) {%PC}/ %joint effusion
            - %migratory polyarthalgias
            - %worsening polyneuropathy, %subtle encephalopathy, %cardiac involvement.
    + other notes on presentation
        * severity/ each feature varies @lcation @different causative species
        * URTI/ GI sx not associated w/ lyme disease == consider viral infx
        * fatigue /non specific sx common in all phases
    + history
        * focus on travel/ activity hx/ tick bites
    + exam 
        * look for EM
- investigate
    + spirochetemia tests not available
    + serology: 
        * IgG/ IgM tests only positive in the late stage (when arthritis or other late features). 
        * @have EM rash, treat immediately, serology will not change rx @++negative.
- treat
    + Abx (commence @EM)
        * 1 of (doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime). Doxy usu used @good @treating common con-infections. duration 21 days.
    + prognosis: 
        * even @spirochetes like syphilis, no damage to fetus @treatment. not transmitted @breast feeding/ vaginal/ sexually
        *   %==fibromyalgia, %progress to chronic lyme disease, %post lyme syndrome




# Anaplasmosis

# Chikungunya fever (CF)
- basics
    + mosquito born alphavirus == acute febrile polyarthralgia/ arthritis. 
    + etymology == "stooped walk" @incapacitating arthalgia
    + endemic west africa, 35-50% population have +ve antibodies to the CV in some areas

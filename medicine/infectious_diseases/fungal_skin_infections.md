###### Fungal skin infections

# Tinea
- basics
    + considered to be a 'great mimicker' of many derm conditions
    + must consider tinea @failed treatment in response to corticosteroid treatment
- investigate
    + micsroscopy with potassiumhydroxide
    + culture
    + woods light examination for scalp
- treat
    + terbinafine, other topical fungals
    + systemic treatment
        * esp for tinea of the palsma dn soles, widespread tinea, or tinea with is unreposnive to topical treamtent
        * use griseofulvin, terbinaafine (esp for ungium)
        * @allergic, can use itraconzaole, flucoanolse.


# Drug eruptions
- can mimic virtually all morphological expressions in dermatology. needs to be high differential for 

# Syphilis
- another mimicker
- scaling erythematous trunkal papules, maculares, copper keratotic paupules
--------------------------------------------------------

# Tinea capitis
- basics
- classification (and basic features)
    + tinea capitis
        * region of alopecia, 
        * mildly infalmed, scaly annular lesions
        * woods light, shows green flueoresecene of the hairs @fungal grow radialy off the hairs (only animal tinea)
        * often asymmetrical
        * mimics seborrheic dermatitis
        * kerion formation
- medical
    + cx
        * kerion formation (abscess @fungal infect), usu tinea capitis
        * may worsen with topical steroids (growth underneath the skin)
- differential
    + alopecia areata (exclamation point hairs, no changes to underlying skin), esp for tinea capitis.
    + trichotillomania (non scarring ill degined patches of alopecia, often angulated, %hair twisting, assoc with underlying anxiety/ depression
    + discoid lupus (scarring alopecia)
    + seborrheic dermatitis
    + pityriasis amiantacea
+ investigate
    * skin scraping (branching septate hyphae)

# Tinea barbae
+ tinea barbae (assoc with dairy farming, affects mustache/ beard area, present with kerion)

# Tinea fascii
+ tinea fascii (often raised edge around the side, often chin/ upper lip, !pets) {animal lover w/ unilateral red face}
+ differnetials
    * seborrheic dermatitis
    * discoid lupus
    * allergic contact dermatitis
    * psoriasis
    * photosensitive eruption
+ clinical
    * presentation
        - 'tin tack' sign

# Tinea corporis
- basics
    + rare
    + circular, waves of growth, central healing/ sparing
- ddx
    + discoid eczema (less defined margin than psoriasis. tram track sign, scales on both sides of the redness, coin shaped lesions, nummular)
    + pityriasis rosea (monorail sign, where there is just one peripheral layer of scale, which is inward pointing. UVB treatment.)
    + psoriasis
    + seborrheic dermatitis (chest/ backs, worse @parkinsons/ HIV)
    + superficial BCC (constant, progressive appearance, shine a lot to the side to reflect off, accentuate with stretching the skin)
    + bowens disease (SCC in situ)

# Tinea manum
- basics
    + usually unilateral involvment with severe bilateral tinea pedis.
    + very fine scale, often in the creases, granular. growing edge. 
    + mild erythema
    + often misdiagnosed @seborrheic dermatitis == corticosteroids leads to worsening of sx
- ddx
    + contact irritant dermatitis (excessive hand washing)
    + contact allergic dermatitis (eg @nickel/ latex)
    + pompholyx (dyshidrotic eczema)
    + lichen simplex chronicus (esp @eczema == rubbing/ scratching)
    + psoriasis
    + pustular psoriasis (usu smoking/ prev smokers)

# Tinea cruris
- basics
    + psoriasis (however dont see typical scales @moisture)
    + allergic contact dermatitis (eg deodorant)
    + erythrasma (bacterial infection esp @folds of teh skin)
    + intetrgio (sweat rash)

# Tinea pedis
- basics
    + esp between toes, %nails, %unilateral
    + mocassin tinea pattern (accumulation in creases), often misdiagnosed @dermatitis of teh feet == corticosteroid use == worsening of symptoms.
    + vesicular inflammatory tinea pedis
- ddx
    + contact dermatitis from shoes
    + psoriasis 

# Tinea ungium
- basics

# Tinea incognito
- basics
    + common @prev misdiagnosed tinea as a mimicker.
- ringworm infection modified by CS, tpical or systemic, prescribed for misdiagnosed tinea. causes cyst/nodule formations. growing edge has papules on teh side.



candida "paratroopers", spread with staellite pustules
tinea ground troopers
psoriasis has a very variable morphology
ketaconaole == hepatic falure and death.

###### Retinal vascular disease
    Blindness
        retinal disease and macular degeneration - 2/3o of all causes
[Bruch's membrane]

# Anatomy
- optic nerve 1.5 mm
- 1/3 larger and darker are the aterioles. cross but do not impinge. arterial reflex absent (vessel walls not pronounced)
- macula 1.5mm, foveal depression
- retinal inner 2/3 supplied @ retinal aterial/ veins/ capillaries
- outer 1/3 choroidal vessels


# Age related macular degeneration
- age related macular degeneration
    + choroidal vascular disease
        * insidious process assoc with aging
        * irreversible central vision loss 
- risk
    + strongest risk @smoker/ recent ex-smoker. not proven sun affecting eyes. 
- progress
    + drusen formation centrally impairs exhchagne of nutrients through bruch's membrane. 
    + 90% dry. complement probably overactive, drugs in development to block cascade.
    + 10% wet, neovascularisation, affects 90% of those with total vision loss. overproduction of VEGF == ++budding of existing blood vessels == leaky blood vessels. the blood vessels grow through bruch's membrane into retina and RPE == distortion of visual field esp @early stage eventually black scotoma
- treatments
    + eye injections with 

# Retinal artery disease
- risk factors
    + same as rf for systemic vascular disease
    + ++emboli == occlusion of retinal arteries
- central retinal arteyr occlusion (amaurosis fugax)
    + sudden painless curtain like loss of vision with previous events
    + or segmental/ visual field loss of vision if a segmental artery blockage. 
    + can often visualise embolus on funduscopy, usu lodges @bifurcation
- treatment
    + rebreathe into bag == ++CO2 == vasodilation == embolus moves into less critical point
    + eye massage (raises pressure == pressure goes down == can dislodge the clot)
    + @catch patient early == needle into cornea == reduce pressure
    + should be treated with anti-platelet therapy/ anticholesterol/ carotid dopplers and vascular opinion @++high stroke risk.

# Retinal vein occlusion and arteriosclerosis
- sudden painless loss of vision, usu unilateral. 
- similar rf to RAD 
- @arteriosclerosis == copper wall vessels == impinging veins == turbulent regions under impingement == ++risk of thrombosis, darker torturous vessels == relative hypoxia in the capillaries @venous back pressure == ++VEGF formation == normal capillaries begin to leak. 
- scatter lazer treatment (may cause pain)

# Retinal capillary disease
    NPDR not vision threatening
    1/3 have PDR / 1/3 have macular edema by 20 years esp @poor HbA1c control.
    @++hypeglycaemia == damage to pericytes and endothelium == sluggish flow
- ++@diabetic retinopathy
    + 25% with diabetes have some degree of DR, about 6% have retinopathy at DM dignosis. 
    + classification
        * NPDR
        * PDR
            - treatment with lazer treatment = visual field loss == more glare (@reflection off laser scars). prevents blindness by protecting macula, but does not restore vision already lost
            - steroid/ anti-VEGF injections @centre involving disease do much better than lazer. small risk of endopthalmitis (1/7-8,000)
        * macular edema
- lower risk of progression @lowering lipids, control hypertension, hyperglycaemia

# Warnings
- @++rapid control of blood sugars == retina becomes reliant on glucose @hypoxic as well == retina rapidly worse. so bring sugars down gradually, 1% per month.



# Blindness





#
- blood dyscrasias (dark red splotch on retina)
- hypertensive retinopathy 
    + swollen optic disc
    + cotton wool spots
- pseudoxanthoma elasticum
    + angioid streaks on retina (assoc with systemic disease, chicken skin appearance on neck)
- choroidal metastases
- gardener's syndrome

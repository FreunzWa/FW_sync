##### Proptosis/ bulging eyes

# Clinical features
- proptosis (exopthalmos)
    + measured @expothalmometer (difference of >3mm is significant)
    + differential
        * approach
            - intra conal
                + lies within cone formed by EOMs, marked @eye displaced directly forward
            - extra conal
                + ==eye displaced off centre
        * VITAMINS

###### Haematopoiesis
- all cell lineages derived from the multipotent haematopoietic stem cell which resides in bone marrow. 
- almost all of the development to produce a functional mature blood cell occurs in the bone marrow, with a few final steps for some cell lineages occurring in the peripheral serum

# Multipotent hematopoietic stem cell; Hemocytoblast/ (HSC)
- ==> CMP / CLP for myeloid and lymphoid lineages

### Myeloid lineage
-------------------------------------------------
- platelets, erythrocytes, myelocytes

# Common myeloid progenitor (CMP)
- arises from the HSC in bone marrow, produces cells from erythrocyte and myelocyte lineages. (RBCs and innate white cells)
- CMP gives rise to 3 lineages:
    + megakaryoblast (platelets)
    + proerythroblast (erythrocytes)
    + myeloblast (innate white cells)

# Erythropoiesis
- development
    + CMP
    + proerythroblast
    + basophilic erythroblast
    + polychromatic erythroblast
    + orthochromatic erythroblast
    + polychromatic erythrocyte (reticulocyte) (%in serum esp @++production)
    + erythrocyte (in serum)

# Thrombocytic lineage
- megakaryoblast passes through development stages (in each stage growing larger, replicates DNA without cytokinesis w/ endomitosis == large lobulated nucleus)
    + 1. megakaryoblast
    + 2. promegakaryocyte
    + 3. megakaryocyte
        * large lobulated nucleus, ++copies of genome.
        * platelets produced through budding which then cirulate peripherally
- signal for development is TPO (thrombopoitein aka MGDF)
    + TPO is produced @liver/kidney, signal for production is low TPO/ IL-6.

# Myelocytic lineage
- 4 main cell types produced (basophil, neutrophil, eosinophil, monocytes)
- developmental stages 
    + myeloblast (from CMP)
    + promyelocyte (starts to show features of eosinophil/ baso/ neutrophil, this continues through developmental stages. thus called eg 'basophilic promyelocyte')
    + metamyelocyte
    + band cell (%in peripheral blood @++production)
    + specialised cell (in serum)
- monocytic lineage is different:
    + myeloblast
    + monoblast
    + promonocyte
    + monocyte (serum)
    + macrophage/ dendritic cells (specialised in tissue)

# Mast cells
- develop directly from the CMP, enter tissue.

### Lymphoid lineage
--------------------------------------------
- produces lymphocytes and lymphoid dendritic cells (central DCs)

# Common lymphoid progenitor (CLP)
- basics develops into all of the cells of the lymphoid lineage (lymphocytes and lymphoid DCs)
- development:
    + CLP
    + lymphoblast
    + prolymphocyte
        * NK cells (large granular lymphocyte)
        * small lymphocyte
            - B lymphocyte == Plasma cells
            - T lymphocyte
- also develops directly into lymphoid DCs.

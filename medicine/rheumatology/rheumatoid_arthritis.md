###### Rheumatoid Arthritis

# Basics

# Medical
- mx
    + actue/ chronic inflammation of synovium with inflammatory infiltrate causing chronic destructive processes of teh joint. Irreversible joint injury as early as 2 years into disease. 

### Treatment
- principles
    + early diagnosis and commencement of DMARDs, with monitoring by a rheumatologist
        * must diagnose in the acute inflammatory stage
    + use of GCs and NSAIDs as adjuncts to main therpay.

# - nonpharmacological
+ patient education,
+ CBT/ psychosocial intervention: may alleviate chronic fatigue, low self esteem, functional disabilities to a degree. 
+ rest (nap, or resting affected joints)
+ exercise (@lack of use the affected joints == muscle atrophy, declining function == fatigue). recommend specific hand exercises and aerobic exercises. 
+ physcial therapy
    * heat/ cold compresses
    * USS (may help with tenosynovitis)
    * splinting to prevent deformity. 
    * relaxation techniques to decrease muscle spasm.
+ podiatrist referral @foot involvement.
+ occupational therapy (assistive device, instruction about use, education about self care)
+ dietary therapy (@RA associated with anorexia == worsening fatigeu)
+ weight loss (decreased stress of joints)

# Pharmacological
- pretreatment evaluation
    + before commencing pharma, must do baseline bloods: CRP/ESR/UEC/FBC/ Creatinine etc/ ATs (@can cause ATs some of the drugs)
    + HEpB/C screening (@incresed risk of reactivation of HepB/C with DMARD therapy)
- protocol
    + MTX monotherapy
    + @CI MTX
        * Monotherapy with (Leflunomide, Sulfasalazine, Hydrochloroquine, TNF inhibitor)
    + Adjunct:
        * Glucocorticoids/ NSAIDs
            - often used at the diagnosis to control initial inflammatory symptoms until the immunomodulators can have an effect.
    + After 3-6 months @not repsonsive to monotherapy, initiate combination therapy:
        * 

- interventional
- other areas which need to be treated
    + Cardiovascular (@increasd risk of CVA, should have lower threshold for commencing anti-lipid therapy, hypertension)
    + Immune function
        * Vaccinations (do not give live vaccines.s) may have a lower response to certain vaccines @immunomodulatory therapy

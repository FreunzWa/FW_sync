###### Autoimmune conditions

# Parry-Romberg syndrome (aka progressive hemifacial atrophy)
- basics
    + rare, progressive degeneration of the tissues beenath skin (bones, muscles) usu hemifacial %extends to other parts of the body. 
    + believed to be type of autoimmune condition @assoc with ANA, %thought to be localised scleroderma.
    + 5-15 ++onset, ++@F
    + have common associated neurological, ocular, oral symptoms
- clinical
    + ocular
        * enopthalmos (@loss of subcut tissue around orbit), Horners (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis), redness of conjunctiva
    + Oral
        * tongue/ gingiva/ teeth/ soft palate commonly involved == %TMJ disorder/ spasm of muscle mastication
    + neurological
        * 45% trigeminal neuralgia (++CNV dermatomal pain)
        * %migraines
        * 10% seizure disorder associated with the disease

# Anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS)
- basics
    + thrombotic condition @heterogenous group of autoAbs agtainst proteins that bind to phospholipids on cell membrane surface. ? == pro-thrombosis/ vascular disease.
- medical
    + Auto-Abs 
        * Anti-cardiolipin antibodies (== -=protein C activity which usu degrades Factor V)
        * Lupus anticoagulant Abs (increase cleavage of PT to thrombin)
        * Protein S auto-antibodies (S usually a co-factor for protein C)  
    + complications
        * can cause pregnancy related cx (recurrent miscarraige, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, placental infarctions)
        * DVT/ stroke/ other vascular/ thrombogenic disease/ PE/ fetal loss/ miscarriage
        * cardiac: Libman-Sacks endocarditis (esp MV and AV), CAD @thrombosis
        * renal: %acute/ chronic renal failure
        * GIT: mesenteric ischaemia/ perforation
    + Etiology
        * Primary (idiopathic)
        * Secondary (50% of cases)
            - SLE/ other autoimmune conditions (35% of all APS cases)
    + catastrophic APS
        * <1% of APS, characterised by ++acute onset (within 1 week) == widespread small vessel thrombosis == multiorgan failure. usu with Hx of APS. mortality 30-50%
    + associated conditions
        * sneddon syndrome (50% of sneddon assoc with APS)
- clinical
    + rf
        * female
        * blaccks, asians, native americans, hispanics
        * HLA associations
    + presentation
        * LR/ LRC/ cutaneous necrosis/ infarction/ digital gangrene/ skin ulcers/ %atrophie blanchie
        * DVT
        * superficial thrombophlebitis
        * %splinter hemorrhages
        * fetal loss
- diagnose
    + occurrence of thrombosis or pregnancy morbditiy when there are detectable antibodies (the Sapporo criteria)
- investigate
    + ELISA (demonstrates IgG/ IgM against cardiolipin or b2-glycoprotein)
    + bloods
        * FBE (thrombocytopaenia)
- treat
    + asymptomatic
        * low dose aspirin/ null
    + thrombosis/ hx of thrombosis
        * warfarin (INR 2-3)
        * aspirin
        * LMWH
        * UFH
        * warfarin + aspirin
    + @pregnancy
        * LMWH/ UFH/ aspirin

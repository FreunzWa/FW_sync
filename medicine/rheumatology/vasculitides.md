    + ++onset @winter @++URTIs, which is the trigger
- clinical
    + presentation
        * Tetrad
            - 75% p/w Palpable generalised purpura w/o coagulopathy ++@lower limbs @gravity
            - 84%arthalgia, migratory/transient/oligoarticular  esp upper limbs w/ %periarticular swelling + tenderness
            - 50% abdominal pain %w/ N/V
            - 50% sx @renal disease (fluid overload/ haematuria etc)
        * Other rarer sx
            - subcutaneous edema ++periorbital
            - scrotal pain 
    + rf
        * HLA associations, male
- diagnose
    + w/ skin biopsy of affected skin purpuric lesion. this is usually reserved for atypical rash or those with ++renal diseaese.
- investigate
    + biopsy of ++skin, %kindey to determine cause of renal impiarment if this is the maikn feature.
    + bloods:
        * normal clotting studies (APTT, PT normal)
        * renal studies (urinalysis - %include presence of red/ white cells)
- rx
    + usu recover spontaneously unless severe diseaase (rare). usu cared for @ambulatory setting. oral hydration + symptomatic relief. elevate edematous areas.
    + pain treatment (arthalgia and abdopminal pain), use NSAIDs/ paracetamol.
    + GCs reserved for fulminant disease @SEs
    + inpatient care @severe disease (eg w/ renal involvement, hypertension, changes in mental status, severe abdominal pain, severe joint involvement)

# Behcet's syndrome (Silk Road disease)
- basics
    + rare, more common @silk road (more severe here as well)
    + small vessel vasclitis w/ systemic manifestations of oral apthae/ genital apthae/ skin lesions/ vascular disaese (w/ aneurysms/ thrombosis)
- pathophysiology
    + can involve blood vessels of all sizes (more commonly small)
- clinical
    + patient
        * 20-40yrs, %in children (and more severe)
        * most cases are sporadic/ but %familial
        * more severe @male
        * HLA-B51 association
    + presentation
        * ~100%painful recurrent mucocutaneous ulcers (more severe than RAS)
        * 75% genital ulceration, painful similar appearance to oral aphthae, recurrent, but less frequent than oral
        * 75% cutaneous lesions (purpura, erythema nodosum, palpable purpura)
        * ~50% ocular disease, w/ ++ episodic uveitis (natural progress to blindness), %cataracts
        * 10% neurological involvement (parenchymal vs. non-parenchymal)
        * vascular disease (aneurysms, thrombosis, venous disease, budd chiari syndrome, dural sinus thrombosis)
        * 50% arthritis
    + rx
        * chronic immunosuppression
        * lidocaine mouth wash
        * ocular disease: require systemic immunosuppression
------------------------------------------------------------

# Polyarteritis nodosa
- basics
    + rare systemic necrotizoing medium vessel vasculitis
- medical
    + mx unknown, ?involve immune complexes == vascular wall inflammation of medium sized vessels, sparing arterioles/ capillaries/ venules. fibrinoid necrosis (eosinophilic staining) of the medium vessel wall. %also affects some small vessel walls
    + cx
        * aneurysm formation == rupture
        * end organ infarction (most commonly the kidneys)
- clinical
    + rf
        * %associated with HBV/ HCV infection (up to 1/3 patients) - usu onset <4 months after onset of HBV infection
        * usu idiopathic (mutations in ADA2 @child cases)
        * hairy cell leukaemia
        * %triggered @drugs
    + presentation
        * skin disease
            - tender erythematous nodules
            - %palpable purpura/ livedo reticularis/ ulcers w/ bullous/ vesicular eruptuion. nodules similar to erythema nodosum. esp ++@lower limbs
        * @renal involvement (most common end organ) == renal insufficiency == RAAS-HTN/ edema/ oliguria/ 
        * b symptoms
        * limb edema
        * %affects larger vessels == ischaemia sx in digits/ limbs
        * 70%neurological (eg peripheral nerve) == isolated asymmetric neuro defect. 5-10%CNS involvement.
        * GI w/ mild mesenteric ischaemia. %havge intestinal ischaemia. cx bowel infarct/ perforation. 
        * %CAD @exacerbation @luminal narrowing.
        * %myalgia/ muscle weakness 
- class
    + cutaneous PA
    + classic systemic PA
- investigate
    + baseline CXR/ ECG
    + blood
        * no elevation in ANCA/ ANA (would suggest else.)
        * cryoglobulins
        * electrophoresis to test for monoclonal gammopathy
        * %mild CK rise
        * HBV/ HCV/ HIV
        * CRP /ESR elevation
        * blood cultures to rule out infection
    + [biopsy] (need to take a deeper biopsy to sample medium sized vessels.)
        * biopsy of any of the PAN skin lesions == shows eosinophilic fibrinoid necrosis in the medium vessel walls.
        * biopsy of the purpuric skin lesion == identical to ANCA purpuric skin lesions     
        * %biopsy renal/ colon @lesion site
    + urinalysis
        * @glomerular ischaemia (not inflammation) == mostly normal (minimal derangements). no Red cell casts.
    + radio
        * mesenteric/ renal arteriography == (showing multiple aneurysm)

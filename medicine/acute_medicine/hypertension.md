###### Hypertension

Hypertensive urgency
- veyr high blood pressure with minimal to no symptoms
- even @180/110 definitely shouldnt quickly reverse @may cause some degree of end organ ischaemia/ renal insufficiency/ watershed infarcts. opt for long term correction
- low risk of complications
- look for common perturbors which may be bumping up the blood pressure artificially (eg high sodium intake, anxiety)
- within a week visit primary care
- in the absence of symptoms probably dont require ECG, but %get renal function

Hypertensive emergency
- @high blood pressure/ malignant hypertension == current complication eg hemorrhagic stroke/ aortic dissection

###### Acid base theory

# Anion gap
- an observed gap between the amount of cations and anions, as many negatively charged molecules are unmeasured. (eg phosphate, sulfate, organic acids, proteins)
- used for evaluating metabolic acidosis (for instace when an acidic species is added to serum == bicarb is neutralised, and the negatively charged anion is unmeasured so does not effect AG)
- quantifies the differece between teh amount of cations - anions in serum
- can thus be used to determine the presence of additional positively charged species (due to the addition of a metabolic acid)
- interpretation 
    + high AG acidosis
    + normal AG acidosis
    + low

# Delta ratio
- assessed elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and evaluates whether a mixed acid base disorder is present. assesses the relationship between a fall in bicarbonate and a rise in anion gap/
- formula
    + DR = change in AG / change in bicarbonate (from normal values. normal AG is 12, normal HCO3- is 24.)
- theory
    + @one molecule of metabolic acid added to ECF, then HCO3- will react to buffer, decreasing HCO3- by one.

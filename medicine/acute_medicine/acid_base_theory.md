###### Acid base theory

# Steps to interpreting a blood gas
- look at pH to look for acidaemia/ alkalaemia
- respiratory component: PaCO2 
- primary respiratory acidosis @hypoventilation
    + pH <7.35 and bicarb normal

#  Base excess
    used to determine degree of metabolic disturbance
    The amount of fixed acid or base added to blood sample to bring to pH of 7.4
- base excess: is dose of acid/ alkali to return in vitro blood to normal pH (normal BE is -3 to +3)
- SBE: dose of acid/ alkali to return ECF to normal pH. this is used for anaemic blood
- interpretation
    + for low BE, i.e. less than -3, means that there is decreased base excess, so base must be added. there is a metabolic acidosis.
    + a high BE means that there is a M.alk



# Anion gap
    observed gap  between positive and negative charge species.
    used to determine presence of unmeasured ions.
    usu 8-16 mmol/L  
[form; Na+ - (Cl-+HcO3-)]
- an observed gap between the amount of measured cations and measured anions. but because of the law of electrical neutrality it also reflects changes in uncharged species as well. 
- how changes in Unmeasured Anions, UC, MC, MA affect AG
    + UA:
        * increased: measured cations will increase, or less MA will be required to maintain electrical neutrality, thus the AG will increase.
        * decreased: less cations, or compensatory increase in MA will be required to maintain electrical charge, thus the AG will decrease

# Anion gap changes
- reduced AG
    + will be caused @increase in UC, @decrease in UA, or @decrease in MC or @increase in MA. 
    + causes:
        *  @decreased UA (due to hypoalbuminaemia, esp in critically ill patients). for every 10 g/L reduction in albumin, AG normal range should fall by 2.3 mmol/ L
        * @increased cationic protein (esp IgG, eg in IgG myeloma)
        * lithium intoxication (++UC)/ %%%hypercalcaemia/ hypermagesemia
- raised AG
    + decreased UC or increased UA. usually almost exclusively UAs from metabolic acids, thus Metabolic acidosis most common form of Raised AG
    + @loss of bicarb to buffer == ++Cl- or other unmeasured anions will increase == raised AG. if Cl- increases then it is a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis
        * causes of RAGMA (basically any acidosis not containing Cl-)
            - lactic acidosis
            - ethylene glycol ingestion
            - DKA
            - lactic acidosis
            - methanol/ toluene intoxication
            - pyroglutamic acidosis
            - starvation (ketotic states)
    + raised AG can also be @IgA myeloma, Raised serum albumin, metabolic alkalosis
- normal AG in setting of metabolic acidosis.
    + caused @Cl- being hte predominant species which maintains electrical neutrality of serum when HCO3- is buffered/ lost/ insufficiently produced.
    + causes of NAGMA
        * Diarrhoea
        * Pancreatic, intestinal biliary fistulas
        * Renal tubule acidosis
        * NH4CL ingestion
        * Hypoaldosteronism
        * 



# Delta ratio
- assessed elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and evaluates whether a mixed acid base disorder is present. assesses the relationship between a fall in bicarbonate and a rise in anion gap/
- formula
    + DR = change in AG / change in bicarbonate (from normal values. normal AG is 12, normal HCO3- is 24.)
- theory
    + @one molecule of metabolic acid added to ECF, then HCO3- will react to buffer, decreasing HCO3- by one. 
- interpretation


# Metabolic acidosis
- disorders == MA usu == ++AG @acid generation buffering bicarbonate. 
- high AG metabolic acidosis
- normal AG metabolic acidosis

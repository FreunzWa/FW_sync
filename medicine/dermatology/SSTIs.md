###### Skin and soft tissue infections

# Cellulitis
- basics
    + bacterial infection @++strep, staph, P aeruginosa %H influenzae, anaerobes, pastuerella @animal bites
- presentation
    + ++unilateral, esp @lower limbs
    + localised erythema/ ++pain/ %itchiness
    + lymphadenitis locally/ fever
    + %abscess/ blister formation
    + %develops scales
- medical
    + cx
        * necrotizing fasciitis 
- diagnosis
    + clinical features suggestive, rule out mimics
- ddx
    + very rarely bil cellulitis, ++stasis dermatitis/ panniculitis
- investigate
    + swabs, blood cultures @septic
- treat
    + fluids, analgesia, abx
    + @complications, involve surgical units

# Folliculitis
- basics
    + inflamed hair follicles %@infection.
- medical
    + %caused @topical streoids, immunosuppression

# Impetigo 
- basics
    + acute, superifical skin infection
    + ++@staph aureus,%strep pyogenes
- medical
    + complications
        * post-streptococcal GN
- treat
    + clean area, N saline
    + antiseptic, Abx ointment
    + %oral Abx indicated esp @systemic features
    + modulate contacts

### Viral skin infections
# Human papilloma virus
- baiscs
    + heterogenous group of viruses
- clinical
    + rf
        * ++@children
        * underlying skin pathology eg eczema
        * biting finger
- rx
    + nil, @the wart will eventually self resolve @immunocompetent patient
    + salicylic acid, immunotherapy (cause allergic contact dermatitis to activate immune system locally), aldara, podophyllin, flurouracil cream, retinoids

# Herpes simplex virus
- basiscs
    + type 1- mainly oral/ facial
    + type 2 - mainly genital
    + @latent period %== asymptoatic shedding
- clinical
    + primary infection ++Severe
    + T1: fever/ vesicles/ gingivostomatisis
    + T2: genital vesicles, ulcers, fevers, lymphadenitis 
- medical
    + nhx
        * latent stage in DRG == reacitvation as cold sore/ gential ulceration
    + complications
        * eye - dendritic ulcer (sight threatening)
        * eczema herpeticum
        * nervous system involvement
        * pregnancy contacts/ immunosuppressed
- rx
    + antiviral medication, start early
        * acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir
    + analgesia, wound mx, bacterial superinfection - treat and monitor 
    + think about involvement of other sites
    + screen for other STDs if suggestive of STD etiology

# VZV infections
- basics
    + chickenpox primary, recurrent w/ shingles 
    + latent period in DRG
- medical
    + triggers:
        * radiotherapy, spinal surgery, immunosuppression, advanced age
    + cx
        * post-herpetic neuralgia (chronic pain, debilitating). must get onto this early @outcomes are better
        * scarring (@deep dermis erosions)
        * dissemination (Ramsay hunt, meningoenephalitis)
        * pregnancy
- clinical
    + presentation
        * prodrome of pain, paraesthesia, systemically unwell w/ fever, headache, lymphadenopathy
        * outbreak of papules == localised blistering == eventually crusting over. reactivation ++%dermatomal, may involve multiple dermatomes
- rx
    + prevent with vaccination
    + antivirals, rest/ analgesia
    + oral Abx @needed

# Molluscum contagiosum infections (MC)
- basics
    + chronic localised infx @MC, which is a pox virus, w/ dome shaped papules
    + often @underlying skin pathology w/ eczema (atopic dermatitis)/ immunodeficiency/ HIV
    + transmitted @direct skin-skin contact/ fomites
    + cases reported worldwide
- clinical
    + rf
        * underlying skin pathology, esp eczzema
        * STI 
        * immunosuppression
        * child
    + presentation
        * location: %genital region (%STI, or auto-inoculation). anywhere apart from palms/ soles
        * papules %with central umbilication shiny. %polypoid lesions
        * %pruritis
- medical
    + cx
        * scarring/ superinfection/ conjunctivitis/ id reaction (disseminated secondary eczema)
        *

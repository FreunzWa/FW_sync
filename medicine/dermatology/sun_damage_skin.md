###### Sun-damaged skin (photoaging)
- photoaging affects people differently, esp @differences @skin phototype, vulnerability, genetics, sex, age, geographical location.
- medical
    + process
        * photoaging in 1-4
            - various lesions/ changes in skin consistency are associated with the photoaging process
        * photoaging in 5-6 
            - photoaging is less severe and occurs later in life (10-20 yrs later). 
            - %rough skin, seborrheic keratoses, solar letigines, mottled pigmentation.

### Features of photoaged skin in phototypes 1-4
    Coarse wrinkles
    Solar elastosis
    Solar lentigines
    Mottled pigmentation
    Actinic keratosis
    Telangiectasias
    Loss of transclucency and elasticity
    Xerotic texture
    Sallow color
    Actinic purpura (Bateman purpura/ Senile purpura)
    Actinic elastosis/ Cutis rhomboidalis nuchae
    Favre-Racouchot syndrome
    Idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis
    Poikiloderma of Civatte

# Actinic elastosis (aka solar elastosis)
- basics
    + abnormal accumulation of elastin in the dermis of the skin/ conjunctiva of teh eye.
    + @++chronic sun exposure (photoaging)
- presentation
    + features
        * thickened, dry, wrinkled skin
        * Cutis rhomboidalis nuchae (deep folding of the posterior neck, very common)

# Solar lentigines (aka lentigo senilis)
- well demarcated pigmented macules on sun exposed areas esp dorsum of hands, shoulder, scalp. 
- @UV exposure, part of the photoaging process
- persistn indefinitely
- ~90% of people caucasian over 60 have thse legions.
- presentation
    + features
        * hyperpigmented macular lesion on sun areas
        * moth eaten border (scalloped edges)
        * pigment network (faint reticulation)
        * fingerprint like areas

# Actinic keratosis (AK)
- basics
    + cutaneous lesion @++proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes (stratum granulosum)
    + UV == mutations in keratinocytes
    + has a risk of progression to SCC
    + v common cause of presentation to dermatologist
    + up to 60% of SCCs arise from AKs, even though there is a small rate of progression to SCC on a year by year basis. 
- investigations
    + ddx
        * differentiate from SCC, may be difficult. 
            - @rapid change/ tender/ ulcerated == more suspicious for SCC
        * benign lichenoid keratoses
        * superficial BCC
        * inflammed seborrheic keratosis
        * porokeratosis
        * inflammatory dermatoses
        * pigmented AKs may resemble LMM
    + when to biopsy:
        * lesions >1cm
        * lesions with underlying substance/ induration
        * rapidly evolving lesions
        * ulcerated
        * tender
        * fail to respond to local treatment
    + biopsy
        * use either shave or punch
        * shave down into mid dermis layer.
    + histology
        * thickening of stratum corneum
        * solar elastosis associated (due to fibroblast damage)
        * dyskeratosis 
- presentation  
    + rf   
        * outdoor occupation 
        * history of sunburn
        * sun protection (sunscreen)
        * skin phototype
        * age/ women
        * geographical region
        * immunosuppression
    + features
        * variable
        * solitary/ multiple
        * sun areas
        * surrouding evidence of skin damage
        * usu <1cm diameter
        * %cutaneous horn develops
        * scaly @hyperkeratosis
    + symptoms
        * %%present with stiging/ local tenderness
- treatment
    + gentle curettage
    + freezing
    + topical chemotherapy (imiquimod)

# Neuropathic ulcer
- basics
- presentation 
    + totally painless/ occur @pressure points w/ punched out morpholoy, usu within thick callous

# Pyoderma gangrenosum
- basics
    + uncommon neutrophilic dermatosis w/ inflammatory ulcers on skin. ++@middle aged adults and women. does not need infection/ gangrene to be PG! usu @underlying systemic disease w/ systemic inflammation
- class
    + classed @appearance (ulcerative, bullous, pustular, vegetative)
    + pustular more ++@IBD
- clinical
    + rf
        * underlying IBD, hematological malignancy, arthritis, familial, neoplasms
    + appearance
        * papule/ pustule ==> painful ulcer with erythematous underminded border and purulent base, often @site of trauma
        * vegetative more superficial/ verrucous, pustular 
    + presentation
        * pathergy (-=trauma == ulcer induction)
- treat
    + local care with wound cleaning w/ saline/ antiseptic. avoid ++pressure/ handling @pathergy == exacerbation.
    + surge usu not @pathergy == worsening
    + meds
        * local corticosteroids
        * local calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus)
        * systemic glucocorticoids
        * systemic cyclosporine, biological agents
- investigate   
    + diagnose @biopsy + exclude infection + features of PG eg. responds to immunosuppressive treatment. no definitive test.
    + skin biopsy: ulcer edge shows neutrophilic infiltrate, but non-specific.
    + bloods
        * FBC (haematoligcal condition), ANA (vascular disorders/ SLE), ANCA (GPA), HBV/HCV/ ix for IBD

# Buruli ulcer (Mycobacterium ulcerans infection)
- basics
    + chronic ulcerating skin infection, usu @developing countries w/ limited health care. known as "Bairnsdale ulcer" in Australia.@contaminated water
- medical
    + ulcerans == local production of mycolactone == cytolysis and ulceration
    + cx
        * progression to deep tissue infection. @HIV == systemic disease
- clinical
    + rf
        * infected @ulcers, usu inoculation through skin trauma @contaminated water. no human-human
    + presentation  
        * begins as painless nodule <5cm diam. %%begins as edematous lesion (more rapid progression)/ plaques/ papules. lesion breaks down < weeks == undermined rim lesion.
- investigate
    + culture: @slow growing do not get rapid yield, poor SN
    + PCR of punch biopsy: high SN (unless edematous form)
- treat
    + Abx according to severity grading. IV rifampin most effective +/- (macrolide, aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone, dapsone)
    + severity class: G1 (<5cm), G2 (>5cm or lesion at critical site), G3 (>15 cm)
        * G1 - abx for 4 weeks, %surgical debride
        * G2 - abx for up to 8 weeks, checking for improvement, @still worsening == surgical debridement
        * G3 - limited surgical excision + grafting + Abx. avoid surge @critical sites.

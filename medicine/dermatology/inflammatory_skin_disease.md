###### Inflammatory skin disease

# Pyoderma faciale (aka rosacea fulminans or rosacea conglobata)
- basics
    + rare cutaneous inflammatory disease w/ large pustular skin lesions
- medical
    + thought to be caused @immunological/ hormonal factors. (explains ++rates @women)
    + triggers may include high doses of vitB6/ vitB12/ ribavirin
- clinical
    + rf
        * ++@women 15-46
    + presentation
        * painful coalescing nodules w/ red-cyanotic centrofacial erythema, cysts, pustules, papules of sudden onset.
        * %severe seborrhea
        * %hyperkeratosis
- treat
    + doxycycline == regression of disease over months
    + %corticosteroids 


# Actinic granuloma
- basics
    + asymptomatic granulomatous reaction affecting sun exposed skin. annular/ polycystic lesions expand centrifugally w/ hypo


# Intertrigo
- basics
    + breakdown of superficial skin @moisture accumulation and friction in skin folds. 
    + common locations: armpits, inframammary fold, spaces between fingers and toes
    + often associated with superimposed candida infection == exacerbation
- medical
    + mx
        * @repeat friction/ moisture == slouphing of the stratum corneum == exposure of Langerhans cells == inflammation and irritation. 
        * may also be initiated @bacterial or fungal infection. 
    + etiology
        * bacterial intertrigo: streptococci, corynebacterium minutissimum
        * fungal: candida is the most common 
- clinical
    + rf 
        * obesity, repeated friction
        * vitamin B6 deficiency
- treatment
    + treat infections
        * in most cases topical antifungals is sufficient to treat
        * %antifungal powders (clotrimazole)
        * systemic antifungals not used as often (fluconazole, nystatin, griseofulvin)
    + reduce moisture at the site
        * antiperspirants, absorbent fabrics

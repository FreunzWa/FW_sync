###### Cancer Syndromes

# Carcinoid syndrome
- basics
    + carcinoid tumors are well differntiated NETs which are considered to arise in the GIT (midgut carcinoids)/ bronchi (foregut carcinoids). or can refer to as neuroendocrine carcinoma
    + carcinoid syndrome @secretion of vasoactive hormones/ molecule == clinical features of the disease
    + there are gastic NET / lung NET variant syndromes
- medical
    + primary NETs divert tryptophan metabolism towards 5HT == excess secretion. serotoninergic syndrome == diarrhoea/ flushing, also 5HT stimulates fibroblasts == valvular plaque formation. 
    + gastric NET == production of histamine (flushing/ prurtis)
    + kallikrein %produced == potent flushing
    + %prostaglandins produced == stimulate intestinal motility == diarrhoea
    + carcinoid heart disease: plaque formation @5HT == fibroblast activation on valvular surface, papillary muscles, endocardium. usu affect right heart. 
- clinical
    + rf
    + presentation
        * 85%episodic flushing hallmark. assoc with midgut NETs (jen down to cecum). acute onset @episode, lasts seconds - 30 minutes. assoc with burning sensation. @flush == drop BP and ++HR. %triggered @certain events. usu affects face/ trunk/ neck. 
        * venous telangiectasia (purple vascular lesions - similar to acne rosacea)
        * 80%secretory diarrhoea (++the worst symptom), usu watery/ non bloody.
        * 20%bronchospasm with wheezing and dyspnoea
        * %cardiac valvular lesions @plaque like depsoits of fibrous tissue @sites of valves 
- investigate  
    + radio
        * colonoscopy

###### Thymic tumors

###### Approach to mediastinal mass
- found @incidental finding in imaging studies (CXR - a widened mediastinum or other opacification, CT, MRI), may also present @mediastinal mass effect / systemic symptoms
- 

###### Thymoma
- basics
    + arise anterior mediastinum tumors, 20% of mediastinal neoplasms are thymomas. 
    + strong association with MG and various other paraneoplastic syndromes
    + usu picked up @incidental lesion @imaging/ paraneoplastic syndrome sx, mass effect in mediastinum. 
- clinical
    + presentation
        * thoracic manifestations:
            - dyspnoea,chest pain, cough, phrenic nerve palsy, SVC syndrome, %pleural/ pericardial effusions
        * paraneoplastic:
            - autoimmune diseaes: 50% have MG, the most common. but other autoimmune conditions are common. 
            - pure red cell aplasia (autoimmune hypoproliferation of erythrocyte precursors)
- investigations
    + imaging:
        * MRI/ CT
            - will show infiltration to surrounding structure. allows some degree of differentiation from thymic carcinoma
            - CT: soft tissue attenuation, between sternum and great vessels. %calcifciations. there are 3 types of thymoma under the WHO classification - A/B/C. C is worst.
    + biopsy
        * defeinitive diagnosis, could include

# Thymic carcinoma
- is more aggressive, with high rates of local invasion.

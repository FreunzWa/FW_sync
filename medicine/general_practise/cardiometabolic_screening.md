###### Cardiometabolic screening

# Diabetes screening
- who
    + increased risk: 
        * for people 40+ and ATSI 18+
        * AUSDRISK should be used every 3 years 
    + high risk: 
        * 40+ and being overweight
        * AUSDRISK score of 12 or more
        * first degree with diabetes, indian/ pacific islanders, all people with previous CVD event, patients on antipsychotics
        * Should do either fasting blood glucose OR HbA1c every 3 years. 
- usu use AUSDRISK first, if elevated risk then get FBG, for very high risk can get HbA1c at the same time. if FBG and HbA1c are disconcordant, OGTT should be done.
- screening tests
    + AUSDRISK
        * assesses 5 year risk of develolping diabtes. 
        * takes information of gender, age, ethnicity, area of born, family history, history of high blood sugar, medication for high blood pressure,  tobacco use, vegetables/ fruit consumption, physical activity (2.5 hrs per week), waist measurement.
        * 5 less: low risk
        * 6-11: intermediate risk
        * 12+: high risk. further testing required -- FBG
    + Fasting blood glucose
        * fasting sample of venous blood for glucose measurement
        * <5.5 Diabetes unlikely, repeat test in 3 years time as recommended.
        * 5.5-6.9: RACGP recommends for equivocal results, do an OGTT
        * 7.0+: Diabetes likely, repeat FBG on a separate day to confirm.
    + HbA1c
        * reflects glycaemic load over 6-8 weeks. subsided @medicare 4 times in 12 month period. at leeast 1 per year for diabetes.
        * diagnostic test for diabetes. 6.5%+ is diagnostic fo ddiabtes
        * more convenient for patients. use with caution with anaemia patients/ chronic disease
        * factors limiting HbA1c results (with fewer RCCs= more glucose per RCC)
            - rcc survival (B12, Fe, Renal impairment, CLD)
            - rcc destruction (splenectomy, splenomegaly, RA, Medications, hemoglobinopathies)
            - glycosylation rate (aspirin, alcoholism, CKD, vitamin C/ E deficiency)
        * important to review to ascertain accuracy of the HbA1c test given blood glucose measurements which are takaen.
    + OGTT - 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test
        * considered gold standard for diagnosis.
        * measure FBG and 2 hours after 75g of glucose taken orally. if FBG is >7.0 and or 2 hour plasma glucose is 11.1+ == Diabetes. <7.8 reading is considered to be normal, otherwise if in the mid range this is impaired glucose tolerance, diagnosis of 'Pre-Diabetes'
        * recommended in all pregnant women 26-28 weeks. 1 hour.
        * @inconvenience not commonlly used for screening
        * used in pregnant women
        * may repeat @borderline result with recalled potential incorrect preparaiton fo the test
- other tests
    + Random blood glucose - can be ordered @the person is suffering symptoms which copulld be consistent with diabetes
        * equivocal result is 5.5-11.0
    + urine testing not necessary @not very sensitive for detection of DM
- recommended intervedntions based on result
    + impaired glucose tolerance/ elevated AUSDRISK, impaired fasting glucose:
        * exercise: 150 mins a week split over 5 days and resistance 2 times per week
        * healthy low fat diet, with low GI foods
        * stop smoking
        * reduce drinking
        * refer pateitns to dietitian and physical activity program
        * provide pre-conception advice to women with a history of GDM

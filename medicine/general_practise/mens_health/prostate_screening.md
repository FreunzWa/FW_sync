###### Prostate Cancer Screening

# Who to screen
- PSA/DRE testing not recommended @low risk men @harms outweight benefits. 
    + low risk men are asymptomatic men with no family history (blood relative) of prostate cancer, under the age of 70.
    + @most tumors detected are the slow growing type, treatment cause damage, chronic incontinence etc
- However @concerned requires informed discussion about the harms and risks associated with overdiagnosis. A patient may decide that they want screening after informed consent. 
- PSA testing is non specific. usu get repeat confirmatory PSA @mildly elevated. 
- DRE is no longer recommended in addition to PSA testing. 
- Biopsy indicated @marked/ rapid rise in PSA
- PSA testing is so ineffective that 1000 people would have to be tested to save just 1 person from prostate cancer.

# The PSA test
- initially introduced to monitor for recurrence/ disease progression after treatemnt. then for screening. 
- PSA (prostate specific antigen) produced by prostate epithelial cells. 
    + %elevated @prostate Ca, BPH, prostatitis.
    + recent urinary retention/ instrumentation (returns to normal within 2 days)
    + recent bacterial prostattis
    + biopsy
- to cause a significiant elevation in PSA
- traditional cutoff for PSA is 4.0 ng/mL. @>10 ng/ml with cancer usually not locally confined and has invaded.  
- unfortunately quite non specific and relatively non SN, especially with a one off test
- most important to do serial testing (improved SN/SP), to measure PSA velocity.
- also investigating the utility of bound-free PSA levels, as in men with prostate cancer the ratio of free to total PSA is reduced. 
    + 8% or lower is considered abnormal
    + a result between 8-29% is considered equivocal

# DRE testing
- not currently recommended to perform this test either alone or in combination with PSA. 
- limited @there are areas which are unreachable @DRE. 
- the majority of tumors detected by DRE are clinically or pathologically advanced. 
- stage T1 tumors are not palpable by definition.
- SN/ SP 51/ 59
- no evidence that DRE in combination with PSA testing improves outcomes.
- PCA3 testing
- may be used to rule out acute prostatitis

###### Guidelines for cancer screening

# Prostate cancer
- screening tests available
    + PSA   
        * should consider teh factors that can artificially change PSA value.
    + DRE is not recommended @poor SN for cancer, esp in certain locations.
- low risk
    + rule in 
        * men >75 or with an LE <10 years with no first degree family history. 
    + screening
        * as prostate Ca is slow growing == should not screen/ interene as more likely to die from other causes
- average risk 
    + screening
        * screening should only be conducted on demand and from a concerned patient who has been educated to the benefits and risks associated
- high risk
    + rule in 
        * men with one or more first degree relative diagnosed <65 years of age
        * Men wth first degree relative of familial breast cancer
    + screening
        * screening should only be given on demand after counselling about possible harms and benefits.


# Colorectal cancer
- screening tests
    + iFOBT
- prevention measures
    + low dose aspirin (even recommended in average risk)
- average risk (95-98% of the population)
    + rule in 
        * asymptomatic people with no history of IBD/ bowel cancer 
        * CAN have one first degree relative or one frist degree and one second degree relative with CRC diagnosed >55 yrs.
    + screening/ prevention
        * iFOBT every 2 years from 50-74 years of age.
        * aspirin for at least 2.5 yrs
- moderately increased risk (1-4% population)
    + rule in 
        * asymptomatic people with 1st relative CRC <55 yrs
        * OR 2 1st relatives diagnosed with CRC any age
        * OR 1 1st relative and 2 2nd relatives any age

        * 3 1st relatives with CRC, at least one diagnosed <55
    + screening
        * refer to faimlial cancer clinic for genetic risk assessment
        * iFBOT from 35-44 every 2 years
        * colonoscopy every 5 years from 45-74
        * management with specialist team, which will also determine aspirin use

# Breast cancer screening
- average risk (95% population)
    + rule in 
        * no confirmed Fhx of breast cancer
        * OR one 1st degree (>50 yrs)
        * OR one 2nd degree (any age)
    + screening
        * breast awareness
        * biennial mammogram from 50-74 yrs
- moderately increased risk (4%)
    + rule in 
        * 1st relative diagnosed <50 yrs
        * 2x 1st relatives same side diagnosed any age.
        * 2x 2nd relatives same side, one <50 yrs
    + screening
        * consider referral to family cancer clinic for further assessment
        * mammogram biennial, but consider annual mammogram from 40 onwards
        * breast awareness
- high risk (1%)
    + rule in 
        * strong family history (ie family members diagnosed <40, bilateral breast ca, Ashkenazi Jeish, breast cancer in male relative)
    + screening
        * referral to cancer specialist
            - possible treatment with long term hormonal therapy
            - may include regular breast examination
            - annual breast imaging with MRI/ mammogram or USS

# Cervical screening test
- now do HPV test (instead of pap test screening), every 5 years from 25 years of age, or 2 years after first having sexual intercourse (whichever is later.)

# Testicular cancer
- do not recommend examinations  (even self examination) or screenng, as this has not shown to increase the detection rate of early tumors, no improvement in survival rate.
- if there is pats history of Testicular cancer orconditions like cryptorchidism/ orchidopexy/ testicular atrophy, then physician do opportunistic examinations

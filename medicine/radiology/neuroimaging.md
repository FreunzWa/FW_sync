###### Neuroimaging


# Signs
- CSF cleft sign for distinguishing extra from intra axial lesions.
    + Does not suppress on FLAIR, suggesting it represents edema with dissolved solutes
    + high T2 signal
    + often used for describing meningioma
- Dural tail
    + thickening and enhancment of th eudra, adjacent to meningioma (most common), or other processes
- Spoke wheel sign
    + @vessels coursing through meningiomas when seen in cross section
- Starburst pattern 
    + same as spoke wheel sign but just different view
- White matter buckling sign
    + @direct compression of extra axial tumor onto brain tissue
- Empty delta sign
    + @filling defect in teh sagitall sinus associated with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, may see similar in transverse sinus
----------------------------------------------------------------


#Vascular Pathology

Cerebral venous thrombosis

- CT
    + visualised hyperdense sinus/ vein @thrombus in the first 7-14 days
- CT venogram
    + filling defect in the sinus/ vein
- MRI   
    + T1, clot is isointense
    + T2, clot is hypointense


# Mass Lesions

Meningioma 

- Description   
    + usu have broad dural base, always extra-cranial/axial masses
    + extra axial mass lesion abutting dura often w/ mass effect.
- Signs
    + CSF cleft sign @CSF signal around cranial aspect of the meningioma 
    + Dural tail in 3/4
    + T2 shows starbust/ spoke wheel pattern of vessels
    + white matter buckling sign represents mass effect
- CT
    + @contast, ++%avidly enhances, %see heterogenous regions
    + non-contrast == either hyperdense or isodense region to brain normal tissue
    + %see hyperostosis @bone reaction @meningioma abutting bone
- MRI
    + T1 usu isointense to grey matter, %hypointense
    + T1 Gd C+ intense and homogenous enhancement
    + T2 isointense to grey matter, %hyperintense
    + DWI/ADC, may have surrounding edema
-----------------------------------------
Glioblastoma (GBM)

-  Description  
    +  @diagnosis usu large, w/  thick irregular enhancing margins and central necrotic core %w/ haemorrhagic component. surrounded w/ vasogenic edema.
-   CT
    +   irregular thick margins w/ iso-hyperattenuating
    +   irreguylar hypodense centre representing necrosis
    +   marked mass effect (look for ventricles/ herniation)
    +   vasogenic edema (hypodense signal on CT)
    +   %hemorrhagic component
    +   %%%calcification
    +   heterogenous enhancement of margins common
- MRI
    + T1 hypo-isointense w/ white matter + central heteogenous signal
    + T1+C, variable enhancement, shows nodular components surrounding necrosis
    + T2/ FLAIR shows hyperintensity, with surrounding hyperintensity @vasogenic edema due to leaky tumor vessels.
    + SWI %show low intensity rim @blood product
    + DWI/ ADC shows moderate diffusion restriction

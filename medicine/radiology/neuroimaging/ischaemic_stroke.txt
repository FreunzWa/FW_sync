=======================BASIC

Ischaemic stroke:
@occlusive event either @intraluminal/ extraluminal/ luminal forces == disruption to blood flow to brain tissue == tissue death proceeds within 30 minutes, but often salvageable recovery @treatment within 6 hrs. 

========================AIM

Aim @imaging:
	Imaging is for diagnosis and aging of strokes, as well as planning for interventional procedures i.e. clot retrieval.
		Aging:
			early hyperacute 0-6 hrs
			late hyperacute  6-24 hrs
			acute 			 24hrs - 1 week
			subacute		 1-3 weeks
			chronic			 >3 weeks
	Most modalities will aim to visualise the development of cytotoxic edema

Modalities
	CT
		CT-Brain 
			immediate baseline test performed @ambo
		CT-Perfusion study C+
		CT-COW (CT-angio) C+
	MRI
		DWI
		ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient)

========================DETAIL
CT-Brain
	aims:	
		exclude ICH
		id early features of ischaemia
		exclude DDx eg tumor
	low SN @hyperacute setting (<6 hrs), depending on location @collaterals exist.
		@deep, high detection in hyperacute (eg lentiform nucleus)
		@MCA territory, 60-70% in the first 6 hrs

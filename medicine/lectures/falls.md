###### Falls

33% chance falling > 65
50% chance falling > 85 
in the next 12 months

at risk of falling:

neurological patients
    post stroke
    sub cortical white matter ischaemic change - binswagger disease? @apraxic/ magnetic gait "walking on hot rocks". - return of primitive reflexes. 
        treatable with statin, ACE, aspirin in the early stages and prevent it from getting worse.
    parkinsons disease, parkinson's plus
        MSA (autonomic failure, ++orthostatic hypotension, usu no tremor and doesnt reposnd to levodopa)
        CBS (alien limb syndrome, mycoclonus)
        progressive supranuclear palsy (postural instability, akinesia, oculomotor nere involement, cognitive dysfunction) minimal response to L-DOPA
            dolls eye (with postural changes the eyes open and close)
            spinal rigidity (cannot see the ground @chronic rigidity)
    dementia

sensory/ peripheral neuropathy patients
    diabetes (retinopathy, neuropathy, autonomic dysfx)
    peripheral nerve palsies (eg foot drop)
    vestibular disturbances (BPPV, )

musculoskeletal
    sarcopaenia/ injury / gait abnormalities

frailty:
    loss of ability to maintain homeostasis following a stressor event. 
    "phenotypic" symptoms/ signs/ diseases and disabilities. 
    "cumulative" decreased muscle mass, slowing down in muscle movement and grip strength (based on actual crtieria)


reasons why people with dementia fall
    gait disturbance due to disase causing dementia
    dyspraxia - loss of learnt motor programs from a young age
    medications - (antidepressants, anxiolytics, neuroleptics:the antipsychotics). better not to use BZDs for long term.
    wandering/ exhaution
    decreased attentiton to comorbid pahtologies
    dysautonomia
    malnutrition
    alterations in sleep wake cycle
    associated incontiennce (perhaps the patients rush to go to the toilet)
    perception that the patient are inappropriate for rehab (as AD patients cannot learn)
    inabilty to use appropriate gait aids




remember the gaits:
    ataxic gaits (cerebellar)
    apraxic gait (subcortical white matter ischaemia)
    parkinsons gait (basal ganglia)

primitive reflexes:
    grasp reflex
    rooting reflex (seek stimulus towards the top lip)
    pouting reflex (tap on the lips)
    glabellar tap (tap on forehead == blinking continuously)
    palmar mental reflex (notch stimulus to thenar eminence == contraction of mentalis)

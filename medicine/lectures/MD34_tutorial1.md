Psych history basics
--------------------

usually aim to establsh rapport with the patient at first, name, age, do on a day to day basis. however in an OSCE bit more impersonal.

Presenting Complaint
- developmental history (mum's health during pregnancy,  postpartum depression?, childhood questions, what was it like in teh home when you were young, siblings)
- standard cardinal features of the presenting comlpiant, have you seen psych, any treaemtens for it. 
- any insight into their illness? could signify psychosi, delusional disorder
- impact on the patient's life (what are you able to do, do you still enjoy doing the same activities)
- Risk  
    + suicidal ideation
        + have you ever thought of harming yourself
        + have you ever made a plan
        + have you ever acted on this plan
        + passive vs. active suicidal ideation (suicide attempts vs. just not wanting to wake up)

Med history
past medical history/ medications

Foresnic/ drugs alcohol gambling history
drugs/ gambling/ 
car accidents/ trouble with police / criminal history been tedadmit

FHx
- anyone in teh family psych ward
    + mum's health during pregnancy,  postpartum depression?, childhood questions, what was it like in teh home when you were young, siblings

Developmental history
- birth to older age

=========================================================

Hallucination - perceiving something that isnt there (either visually or auditory, all other senses but they are much more unlikely)
Delusion
- a fixed unshakeable belief in something that isnt true delusion, hallucination
- primary delusion
- secondary delusion (can arise from another)

==========================================================
Elements of a MSE 
- Appearance
    + objective description, helping someone to pick out someone out of the waiting room. comment on clothing. grooming. 
- Behaviour
    + Movement: gesticulation, gait disturbance, manic, fidgeting. 
    + Eye contact: avoiding/ maintaining/ too much
    + Engagement: non-engaging/ engaging
- Speech
    + Route taken: direct response to question/ tangential in response? 
    + Amount/ Speed
    + Prosity/ Volume 
    + flight of ideas
- Mood
    + mood is exactly what the patient describes to be:
    + "the person reports their mood to be:"
    + euthymic == happy
- Affect
    + What you perceive the patient to be feeling
    + may be congruent vs. incongruent
        * relationship between affect and the subject matter.
    + quality (dysthymic, euthymic, euphoric)
    + Flat, Blunted (implying psychosis/ schizophrenia), Labile/ Hyperreactive (BPAD), Fatuous (not present in teh conversation/ vacant/ silly/ superficial), Perplexity (bewildered by everything)
    + Quality/Reactivity/ Range/ Congruence
    + 'communication of affect' - if the patients affect changes your mood
- Thought form
    + how they formulate and orgnaise their thoughts. 
    + either tangential
    + derailment (illogical jump to another topic)
    + cirumstantial (over-inclusion of ideas - go off on other topics but come back to the point)
    + 'word salad' - random disconnected words as a result of a psychotic condition, psychotic depression
    + latency: (delay between getting asked a question)
    + blocking: stop talking mid-sentence. 
- Thought content
    + 'meaning of the words' - summarise what the patient has told you. eg thought content was consisted of grandiose ideas about taking over the world and establishing a new race on the moon, or the patients thought content was consistent with suicidal ideation
- Perception
    + presence of hallucinations? (often people lie about their hallucinations)
    + responding to internal stimuli? 
    + 'no perceptual disturbances were elicited'
- Cognition
    + "Grossly intact and oriented to time person and place"
    + Can also then follow up with standardized testing (RUDAS/ SMMSE)
    + Attention, Praxis, recall
- Insight'
    + Does patient think anything wrong with them (do they think symptoms are normal?)
    + Does patient think they have psych disorder (do they think their diagnosis is real?)
    + Does patient think that they will benefit from treatment?
- Judgement
    + how well can person make a balanced apprasial of their circumstnaces (would the person be able to cross the road and take the approrpriate precautions.)
- Risks
    + risks to self
        * self harm/ suicide
        * neglect/ misadventure/ gambling
    + risks to others
        * deliberate
            - aggression, assault, homicide
        * unintentional
            - neglecting, driving while manic, leaving a fire on causing 
            - manslaughter

Formulation???

===========================================================

Falls history: 

Practise #1
75 F Jacinta 
painful right leg, bruise.
just fell over after standing up from sitting position
on the ground for 20 minutes
negative palps, TLOC,  
been told to use a frame, but doesnt like to use it

3am fall, was getting up to go to the bathroom, fell over on the way
doesnt think trip on anything
2+ times going to the bathroom
not ill recently
tingling sensation at night

HTN medical history =
Valium


Valium + Urgency + dark + sarcopaenia == risk of falling

1. usual introduction
2. history of PC (tell me what happened), establish if lost consciousness or not (if syncope == syncope history, not falls)
3. Before: tell me how fell (slip/ trip/ lost balance/ risky behaviours/ was it dark/ basically the circumstances of the fall)
4. D (what did you fall on, what surface did you fall on)
5. A (how did you get up off teh ground, how long were you on teh ground for, rhabdomyolysis). did anyone else ssee the fall
6. any near falls, history of falls

Consequences of falling:
- developing fear of falling == increased risk of falling @change gait to compensate
- what is the impact of having the fall on life (eg fear of going outside)
- impact on mood

Move on to extrinsic/ intrinsic:
('i'm just going to move on to what may have contributed to your fall')
- Extrinsic
    + personal
        * footwear
        * 4WF, walking aids
        * alterred sensation in the feet
    + domestic
        * tripping hazards
        * living arrangement
        * have you ever had an OT assessment before
        * if they have a personal alarm 
    + risky behaviour
- Intrinsic
    + cognitiion (dementia/ delirium)
    + senosry (vision)
    + cardiac (low BP, arrhythia)
    + balance
    + neuro
    + metabolic
    + medications (sedatives/ alcohol)

MHx:
- medical condition
- medications, medication changes
- other geriatric syndromes, incontinence

Medications:
- Benzos / sedatives

pADLs/ dADLs/ cADLs
ask about weight loss (in case they are not cooking meals properly.)

How do you intend to plan/ change your behaviour for the future.
Should have something to say about every allied health in general, and then specific scenarois.


OT: assess ability to perform ADLs then do home assessment to assess if they can achieve their ADLs in this environment
Pharmacotherpay: review medicaitons, remove or change time when medications are givne. reduce polypharmacy and get a webster pack.
Nursing staff: wound care, appropriate bedsore managmenet
Physio: functional xercises to strengthen muscle groups
optometrist review: remove bifocal lens (associated with increased risk of falls, hearing aids?)

Prevent:
Falls injuries: hip protector, treat osteoporosis, education on how to get up from teh floor to prevent complciations of a long lie. 

==========================================================
Static stance
Romberg's 
- bit more risky @losing vision
time to get up and go
functional reach
sternal push (someone behind)
shoulder tug (catch them in front)
the exam is targetted, using histyr and chasing down differentials.

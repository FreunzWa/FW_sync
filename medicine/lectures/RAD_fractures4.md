###### Radiology Fractures - Lecture 4

# Case 1 (proximal humeral fracture)
- there is a minimally displaced fracture involving the surgical neck of the humerus and the greater tuberosity.
- proximal humerus, looks to be communuted fracture involving the neck of the humerus. inlocated in the glenohumeral socket.
- also look for fractures in other bones, any dislocation.
- look at joints
    + look for malalignment, esp the AC joint, glenohumerual joint, use lateral projection as well. 
- soft tissues
    + bursa enlarged? bursitis 
    + effusion?
- spiral fractures are more common when there is comminution of the bone.
- Neer classification (how many fragmenets?)


# Case 2 (humeral head fracture + clavicular fracture)
- shear fracture of the growth plate in the proximal humerus.
- Salter harris types
    + 1: shear fracture of the growth plate (most common in teh proximal fmur in teh slipped upper femoral epiphysis - SUFE)
    + 5: fracgture line going through diaphysis and the growyht plate (poor otucomes)
- with realingment of the growth plate growth outcomes are pretty good, but there is a limited time frame. SH 5 is the worst possible..
- shear actually isnt as


# Case 3 (humeral head dislocation)
- humerla head disloaction, inferiorly and anteriorly (confirmed on lateral view)
- dislocation of humeral head
    + anterior much more common than posterior dislocation (80-90%). quite a commmon dislocation @poor apposition of GH joint.
- look at the other bones
    + scapula/ clavicle okay
- Hill Sack's deformity
- bankart injury
    + @dislocation fo humerus inferiorly == impact of humeral head aginst lower lip fo teh glenoid fossa == frcture


# Case 4 
- elbow dislocation, distal humerus dispaced anteriorly
- radial head fracture
- can see small bone fragments, suggestive of comminuted injury
- coronoid process is likely fractured @distl humerus impact against it.
- some degree of lateral subluxation as well.
- joint effusion, cn see the fat pads have been raised by fluid.


# CAse 5
- paed xray of elbow, can see the growth plates
- teh eblow in paeds is quite complicated. very high stakes @cn ruin alingment and boney growth in the future at misdiagnose injury
- need to know the ossification centres very well.
- can see an osificiation centre in the ulnar region, which would usually be the trochlear ossification centre by anatomy, but are missing the medial epicondyle ossification centre - which mens that the medial epicondyle trochlear has migrated down to the trochlear location
- normal oder
    + capitulum
    + radial head
    + medial epicondyle
    + trochlear


# Case 6
- ulnar diaphysis oblique displaced fracture and proximal dislocation of the radius
- paeds
- monteggia vs. galeazzi
    + the naming system is the same for distal vs proximal.

# Case 7
- @equivocal for fracture == immobilise it, put it in a plaster and review in 1-2 weeks. just treat it like a fracture
- scaphoid fracture appears after 1-2 weeks.

# Case 8 (trans-scapoid perinulate fracture dislocation)
- lunate dislocated from rest of the hand (dorsal dislocation foteh capitate in relation to the capitate, aka perilunate dislocate)
- scaphoid fracture (@see a perilunate dislocation always look for a scaphoid fracture)
- TFCC should always be looked at to look for widening which could be suggestive of ligamentous injury.
    + TFCC location is common for gout/ osteoarthritis/ RA changes
- CT clearly shows the mid-scaphoid fractureCase 9 


# Case 9
- fracture of proximal 1st MCP, extra-articular, moderately displaced, maligned. maybe comminuted. 
    + if it is intra-articular, then requires orthopaedic review automatically.
    + poorly aligned, cant fix the bone in place then will require orthopaedic review.


# Case 10
- AC subluxation. the clavicle is raised laterally. asymmetrical to other side.
- (can get patient to hold weights and that AC joint will be widened)


# Case 11:
- diaphyseal oblique left 4th metacarpal frcture.

###### Acute Abdomen Imaging

# Techniques
- look at the abdominal fat

# Case 1 (Appendicitis)
- See fat stranding on the right side, consistent with the right iliac fossa
- Appendicitis likely @RIF inflammation, look at coronal as well @axial often not ideal view
- first must find appendix, find the terminal ileum entering the caecum, and go search around that area by a few plane thicknesses. find the ileocaecal vavles, which usually has a bit of fat in it (crescent of fat - looks blacker than the rest)
- Features of appendicitis
    + periappendiceal fat stranding
    + appendiceal wall thickening
    + faecolith or engorged lymphatics
    + dilatation >6mm
    + locules of gas @perforation 
    + features of peritonitis @appendiceal perforation 
    + abscess formation @delayed presentation
1. look for appendix, drawn attention @RIF fat stranding + clinical presentation
2. look for iliocaecal valve @ileocaecal fat as a feature, search around this area for the appendix
3. look for features of appendicitis as above.

DDx (on imaging)
- Meckel's Diverticulitis
- Diverticulitis
- Terminal ileitis
- Colitis
- Bowel Obstruction
- IBD

# Case 2 (diverticulitis)
- See fat stranding around the sigmoid colon posterior to bladder
- can see small loculated gas bubbles @diveticuli, can see ++diverticulosis @proximal large colon. 
- look for complications of teh diverticulitis == enhancing rim with containted perforation (walled off abscess) @late/ recurrent presentation. 
- complications of sigmoid diverticulitis
    + bowel obstruction
    + perforation == peritonitis == sepsis
    + fistulae formation == recurrent UTIs (look for distortion of the bladder, eg tenting of the bladder, look for passage of contents - bladder gas or cathether contrast directly into the bladder to prove abnormal communication)
- to look for free gas, use a lung window, makes the black stick out much more. free gas would sit under the anterior abdominal wall or underneath the liver. (can easily miss a small perforation on standard abdominal window.)
Ddx:
- sigmoid colitis
- ulcerative colitis
- infectious colitis
- diverticulitis

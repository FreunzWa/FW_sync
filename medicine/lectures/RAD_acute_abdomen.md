###### Acute Abdomen Imaging

# Techniques
- look at the abdominal fat

# Case 1 (Appendicitis)
- See fat stranding on the right side, consistent with the right iliac fossa
- Appendicitis likely @RIF inflammation, look at coronal as well @axial often not ideal view
- first must find appendix, find the terminal ileum entering the caecum, and go search around that area by a few plane thicknesses. find the ileocaecal vavles, which usually has a bit of fat in it (crescent of fat - looks blacker than the rest)
- Features of appendicitis
    + periappendiceal fat stranding
    + appendiceal wall thickening
    + faecolith or engorged lymphatics
    + dilatation >6mm
    + locules of gas @perforation 
    + features of peritonitis @appendiceal perforation 
    + abscess formation @delayed presentation
1. look for appendix, drawn attention @RIF fat stranding + clinical presentation
2. look for iliocaecal valve @ileocaecal fat as a feature, search around this area for the appendix
3. look for features of appendicitis as above.

DDx (on imaging)
- Meckel's Diverticulitis
- Diverticulitis
- Terminal ileitis
- Colitis
- Bowel Obstruction
- IBD

# Case 2 (diverticulitis)
- See fat stranding around the sigmoid colon posterior to bladder
- can see small loculated gas bubbles @diveticuli, can see ++diverticulosis @proximal large colon. 
- look for complications of teh diverticulitis == enhancing rim with containted perforation (walled off abscess) @late/ recurrent presentation. 
- complications of sigmoid diverticulitis
    + bowel obstruction
    + perforation == peritonitis == sepsis
    + fistulae formation == recurrent UTIs (look for distortion of the bladder, eg tenting of the bladder, look for passage of contents - bladder gas or cathether contrast directly into the bladder to prove abnormal communication)
- to look for free gas, use a lung window, makes the black stick out much more. free gas would sit under the anterior abdominal wall or underneath the liver. (can easily miss a small perforation on standard abdominal window.)
Ddx:
- sigmoid colitis
- ulcerative colitis
- infectious colitis
- diverticulitis


# Case 3 (bowel obstruction)
- fluid air levels visible in the large colon (the colon is peripheral and the haustra are visible, they dont go all the way across)
- looks dilated
- see evidence of diverticulitis - could be diveticulitis == inflammation == obstruction
- can see evidence of vesicolic fistula.
- complications
    + look for perforation (free gas)
        * look for free gas under diaphragm
        * Rigler's sign, look for double wall sign 
        * look for evidence of obstruction (eg hernia, on CT can look for inflammation of bowel/ facelith)
        * tumor?
- @tumor is a differential == must do colonscopy to exclude possibility of tumor.

# Case 4 (pneumoperitoneum)
- erect CXR can see @++air air trapping under diaphgram, however SN for small perforation is very low == not the most useful test.
- rigler's is a bettersign
- lateral shoot through == gas rises to the top. (esp good for babies @ easy posture.)

# Case 5 (pancreatitis)
- can see fluid in the peritoneum, can use the HU measurer to check what type of tissue the cursor is likely to be. also can compare known substances on CT (eg compare to fluid or CSF in the spinal cord.)
    + blood 40-60 (esp acute blood is high.)
    + urine/ water 10-20
- peripancreatic fat stranding
- the pancreas looks enlarged (fat nodular pancreas) @pancrreatitis 
- necrosis of pancreas? w/ hypodensity.
- abscess/ pseudocysts/ walled off necrosis @the fluid stays there for prolonged period (pseudocyst early, walled of necrosis >4 weeks.) the fluid usu dissipates.
- %see aneurysm @enzyme release from pancreas == digestion of the aortic wall.


# Case 6 (AAA)
- aorta has ++aneurysm emanating from the left aspect.
- ruptured aneurysm posteriorly into teh left psoas area which is walled off == patient ahs survived.
- can see annular rings around the aorta, likely repeated thrombus and hemorrhage for long period.


# Case 7 (emphysematous cholecystitis pneumobilia)
- can see branching lucency on the erect CXR in right upper quadrant
- pt with sepsis and RUQ pain (sounds like Reynaud's)
- gas in gall bladder and gall bladder wall (high mortality)
- usu diabetics/ aged population
- 


# Case 8 
- extremly thicked wall cholecsystis
- 2-3 mm is normal , this is 1.5cm, very thick
- make diagnosis of cholecystits @can see stone and murphy's sign
- acalculus cholecystitis usually only @very chronically sick w/ TPN, chronic opiates use, long time crticial illness.
- every female is pregnant until proven otherwise - must always do pregnancy test (urine pregnancy test + bHCG vascular)
- signs
    + distended gall bladder
    + stone
    + murphy's sign
    + wall thickening
    + hyperaemia
    + pericystic free fluid


# Case 9 (adnexal mass)
- ectopic pregnancy
- look up treatment
- bHCG does not rise very much in ectopic pregnancy
- ectopic pregnancy is ruptured @can see that there is free fluid (which is normal), but the fluid has higher desntiy suggestive of hemorrhage in teh pelvis
- most ectopics are tubal rather than ovarian ectopics



# Case 10 (multitrauma)
- renal injury (renal pelvis involved, allowing urine to leak == infection) 
- splenic injury
- liver laceration
- CT-IVP renal phase showed urine leak into the retroperitoneum, perinephrically. 
- probably will require nephrectomy.
- angiogram of the left kidney shows extremyl limited vascular suply to the superior component of the left kidney.
- huge haematoma in teh left peritoeneum
- spleen infarcts become more and more hypodense.
- liver healing later on.
- in multitrauma, if they are unstable, first step is embolisation @radiology. with CT angiogram. 


# Case 11 (venous bowel ischaemia)
- bowel appears distended, bowel wall thickened
- venous thrombus visualised in the superior mesenteric ischaemia
- dilated congested venous channels.
- stranding visualsied in the peritoneum
- look for enhancement in contrast, the wall will have reduced contrast enhancement @less blood getting there.

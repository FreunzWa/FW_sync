###### Lecture 14 - Joints

# Case 1 (Left Hip Osteoarthritis)
- increasd density of subchrondral surface of acetabulum and femoral head (subchondral sclerosis)
- joint space narrowing
- marginal osteophytosis
- boney cysts



# Case 2 (Rheumatoid arthritis Hands)
- sclerosis of the carpal bones
- periarticular erosion @2nd R) Metacarpal
- osteopaenia? lucency of the bones in apposition with articular space
- RA:   
    + periarticular erosions
    + joint space narrowing
    + soft tissue swelling
    + juxta-articular osteopaenia
---------------------------------

# Case 3 (Gout)
- juxta-articular punched-out erosion w/ surrounding sclerosis cortical based
- soft tissue swelling
- intracortical tophaceous gout

# Case 4 (bil OA)
- varus deformity biterally
- joint space narrowing medially w/ subchcondral sclerosis
- intra-articular erosions of the R) knee
- marginal osteophytosis
- medial is the most common compartment to be involved @++weight bearing surface
- Kellgren-Lawrence grading system

compartments of the knee: patello-fermoal/ medial/lateral

# Case 5 (septic arhtritis + osteomyelitis)
- joint space narrowing, periarticular erosions
- loss of the normally sclerotic cortex
- low T1 signal intra-osseous with boney edema detectedon T2
- oftne give contrast to look for any correction 
- edema surrounding the joint @joint effusion @infection.

# Case (Ankylosing psondylitis)
- 25M presented to GP with back pain. ESR > 80
- Sacroiliitis (@the start get inflammation/ erosion)
- SIJ widening w/ surrounding sclerosis
- superior aspect of the joint fused on the left.
- Dagger sign not quite positive. (when teh spinous processes have fused - not ligamentum flavum hypertrophy)
- HLA-B27 positive
- erosions in the antieor aspect of L1/L2 (what is the name of these lesions)
- loss of normal lumber lordosis

# Case 7 (synovial chrondomatosis)
- bilateral knee swelling in 40M
- multifocal nodules of bone density superior to the femoral condyles bilaterally, 
- subchondral sclerosis
- loose bodies in the synovium @synovial chrondromatosis
- cause degenerative changes
- rf   
    + degenerative ojint disease
    + neuropathic joitn disease
    + truama history

# Case 8 (Charcot's foot disease - Neuropathic joint disease)
- 45M T1DM neuropathic joint disesae
- sclerosis of the tarsal bones
- loss of plantar arch
- comminuted bone fragments/ fragmentation of the bones.
- boney alignment, lateral subluxation of the proximal phalanx relative to the 

# Case 9 (dislocated L-Hip THR)
- left hip pain in 60F, 2x previous THRs
- THR bil metalware in situ, dislocation of the acetabuluar, superolaterally. most likely anterior dislocation.
- always look for fractures
- lucencies?
- any inflammatory reaction to the THR metal
- 

 

# Questions 
- how to tell the difference between RA/ OA
    + asymmetrical joint space narrowing (weight bearing more in OA)
    + juxta-articular osteopaenia more common @RA @inflammatory infiltrate is present
    + periarticular erosions in RA
    + more soft tissue swelling @RA @inflammatory hyperaemia

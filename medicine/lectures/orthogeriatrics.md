###### Orthogeriatrics

- prehab (prepare for elective operations, aim to strengthen the paitent before an operation)
    + control pain, manage all co-morbidities, pre-operative physiotherapy
- emergency (no prehab possibility)
- aim for an operation that will allowt the patient to be up and moving straight away



gardens classification (Grade 1-4)
- prognosticates chance of avascular necrosis.
- 1-2 grading likely to survive, 3-4 likely to AVN
- 3-4 will require hemi/full arthroplasty
    + becoming more and more common

- hemi: just a ball that sits in the acetabulum (short poeration, may be better for old frail who may not tolerate a long operation)
- full: @previously damaged acetabulums. requires at least an hour operation 
- DHS (dynamic hip screw, requires that the head is healthy) (short operation so often appropriate for older)

post op:
- paracetamol
- NSAIDs vs. opiates (opiates have fewer adverse side effects in the older age group esp @reduced kidney fucntion and gastric ulceration, esp triple whammy for kidney or patints with poor renal function)
- narcotics: oxycodone (one of the best choices for elderly), fentanyl, buprenorphine, morphine (dont use buprenorphine as much @++nausea), tapentadol, tramadol (causes ++nausea in the elderly - better for younger)
- DVT/PE prevention. blood thinners. always get LMWH, using heparin and also NOACs from time to time (esp rivaroxaban)
- early mobilisation
- what blood tests:
    + CRP will rise anywhere
    + ESR (>100 == endocarditis and myeloma)
    + PTH (PTH elevation with normal Ca2+ usu @hypovitamosis D) 
    + CMP
    + Vitamin D
    + thyroid (thyrotoxicosis can cause osteoporosis)
    + celiac's disease (calcium wasting) - but really only in younger patients.
- aperients
    + coloxyl+senna (if the patient is not opening the bowels)

osteoporosis:
- denosumab (requires injection)
- bisphosphonate (reflux esophagitis/ esophageal 
    + nincreases the risk of atypical freactures
    + atypical fractures between the 1/3 and distal 2/3 of the femur, usu after starting bisph 5-10 years ago. better to stop bisphosphonates after 5 years. caused @poor bone formation @lack of boney remodelling. usu here@forces here.
    + may see a very thick cortex
    + may also see beaking @microfracturess 
- perforation)
- calcium + vitD
- denosumab can also cause atypical fractures. (denosumab usually 6 monthly)
- endocrinology teripertide (stronger drug for osteoporosis)

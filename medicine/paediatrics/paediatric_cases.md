- 13y M, acquired severe chronic dystonia and total cortical blindness secondary to hypoxic brain injury following asthma attack 2 years ago. charactristic opisthotonus posturing. good baseline before this, mild autism. gets intrathecal infusion for severe dystonia with baclofen. neurocognitively grossly intact. 
- 4m M, likely NAI with bilateral subdural hemorrhages, cortical contusions, retinal hemorrhages, thoracic ecchymosis. nil broken ribs. CT shows possible old subdural hemorrhages. forensics involved and parents legally ordered to stay away from the child
- 15y M, acquired traumatic brain injury with severe ICP increase. preventative measures for 2ndary brain injury with intraventricular peritoneal shunt, ICP monitoring, hypertonic saline (prevent cerebra edema by maintaining sodium >140 mmol/ L), maintain CPP (MAP-ICP) with hypercapnia, 30 degree incline, maintain MAP. neurologically poor prognostic factors, sluggish pupillary response. 
- 3y F, presented with episodic fevers of uknown origin for weeks + headaches. eventually LP ordered == showed motile protozoan organism. unable to identify organism, despite sending to specialised parasite centres. has so far been resistant to treatment
- 3m F with undiagnosed communicating hydrocephalus had an intraventricular shunt put in. 
- 12 y M with medulloblastoma

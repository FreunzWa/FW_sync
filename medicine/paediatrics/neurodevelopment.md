# Cerebral palsy
    persistent but not unchanging move disorder due to defect/ lesion in teh developing brain; acquired <5 yrs. 
    move disorders include posture/ dystonia
    GMFCS is used to classify the severity of CP -- bsaed on the ability of gross motor function and mobility

- medical
    + common cx
        * pneumonia (esp aspiration/ CLD)
        * uncontrolled seizures/ status epilepticus
        * unexplained irritability
        * constipation (@-=immobility)
        * osteopaenia
    + etiology 
        * fetal comrpomise/ hypoxxia during delivery == HIE
        * preterm
        * genetic causes
        * hypoxia to infant brain (eg crib suffocation)
- clinical
    + presenting complaint
        * follow up of at risk infants -- eg preterm 
        * delayed motor milestones (esp sit, stand, walk)
        * asymmetric motor patterns (hand preference <18m)
        * spasticity/ hypotonia
        * severe feeding difficulties/ unexplained irritability
    + features
        * isual problems
        * hearing defecits
        * speech/ language problems
        * epilepsy (50%)
        * cognitive impairment (learning/ intellectual disability)
        * FTT
        * incontinence (@detrusor overactivity / intellectual impairment)
        * orthopaedic problems (esp @contractures == hip dislocations. knee/ ankle deformities, club foot - talipes equinovarus, limp)
        * choking/ aspiration episodes
- investigation (usu clinical diagnosis but other tests may be done)
    + @clear history (eg neonatal compromise/ encephalopathy) == no ix required
    + @unclear:
        * urine/ plasma metabolic screen
        * consider congenital infections
        * chromosomal analysis
        * MRI - vascular lesion/ malformation/ perventricular leukomalacia
    + all require hearing/ visual assessment
    + cognitive assessment to provide help with education
    + vitD levels (@often insufficient intake/ sun exposure)
- rx
    + spasticity:
        * medications: diazepam, dantrolene sodium, baclofen
        * inhibitory casts
        * botox A reduces localised spasiticity
        * intrathecal baclofen @severe spasiticity
        * selective dorsal rhizotomy (anterior spinal roots sectioned)
    + @feeding difficulties == NGT/ gastostomy feeds (esp @FTT/ major feeding problems, aspiration)
    + AEDs for epilepsy
    + multidisciplinary team + family input
        * phystiotherapists
        * occupational therapists (recommend suitable toys, equipment and home adptations)
        * speech pathologists (also feeding difficulties and saliva control)
        * othotists, medical social workers, psychologists, special education teachers, nurses

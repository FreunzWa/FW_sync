###### Sudden infant death syndrome
    aka crib death. leaeding cause of infant mortality <1 year in ndeveloped. 
    defined @sudden death in infnat <1 yr of age after thorough investigation of death/ autopsy.
    SUID - sudden unexpeected infant death. includes SIDS
    greatest reductions @encourage supine sleeping.
    more common between 2-4 months of life.

# Medical
    SIDS known not be genetic @no increased risk @siblings. and no concordance in twins.
- rf (more than 95% of SIDS cases @1+ risk factors)
    + infant/ environmental factors 
        * higher risk 15-20% 
        * OR 1.50 for males
        * prone/ side sleeping position
        * preterm/ low birthweight
        * sleeping on soft surface esp with bedding accesesories.
        bed sharing (eg sleep in parents bed)
        * hot environment 
        * history of apnoea or otherwwise impaireed respiratory function
        * intercurrent illnness
        * 2-4 months of life
    + maternal factors
        * young maternal age (<20 yers)
        * maternal smoking 
        * no prenatal care
- pathogenesis
    + triple risk model: underlying vulnerabvility + trigger event (eg airway obstruction) at a developmental vulnerable stage.

# Prevenntion
- firm surface with supine position
- sleep in parents room but not in parents bed
- avoid soft objects and bumper pads in the bed, infants head uncovered.
- avoid overheaeting, infannt lightly clothed for sleep.
- tummy time - recommend prone positioning when infannt awake @helps development of shoulder girdle strenngth. often can do this with changing nappies.

# Conductive hearing loss


- 'glue ear' middle ear effusion
    + examination
        * effusion present? 
    + investigations
        * audiometry + tympanometry
    + management    
        * reassurance and monitoring, repeat audiology result @no delay in development
        * ENT - grommets @developmental delay
            - private ENT specialist @very long waiting list 
        * speech pathologist referral
            - @delayed development and unlikely to improve @grommet insertion quickly @poor social developmental supports

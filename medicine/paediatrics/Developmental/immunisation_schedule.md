# Approach to discussing vaccinations
- discuss and elucidate concerns
    + 
    + find out knowledge of vaccines they have
- herd immunity
    + 95% required for measles, but virtually impossible to achieve so cannot rely on herd
- providing information
    + give information on knowledge gaps
- side effects
    + common
        * short lived mild fever
        * unsettled, unhappy
        * sore, red @vaccination site
- live vaccine side effects
    + rotavirus
        *   mild case of rotavirus which can be contagious. rare Intussusception
    + MMRV
        * delayed rash, delayed fever (7-10 days later)
- rare side effects
    + febrile convulsions
    + hypotonic, hyporeponsive episode (floppy pale unresopnsive baby 1-48 hrs. fully recovers) 
    + anaphylaxis
    + brachial neuritis
    + GBS (ascending paralysis and numbness)
- Vaccine safety service
    + call number to discuss side effects

# Vaccine preventable diseases more common?
- Pertussis
    + more common in older w/ chronic cough @waning immunity == can pass to baby
- Varicella
    + Requires more than one dose (other private) for good protection
- Meningococcal
    + Many different strains (eg MenB is quite expensive)
- Pneumococcal 
    + inadequate coverage of all strains.
- Measles
    + REquire high immunity for herd immunity. can be transmitted from overseas. 


# DTPa vaccine
    Diptheria tetanus acellular pertussis "Boostrix"
- prior ws the whole cell pertussis vaccine, however DTPa better @because the immunity lasts longer into adolescence. 
- now a total of 6 doses given, the final one given from 10-15 to combat waning immunity.

###### Nocturnal enuresis
- incontinence is a common problem, 15% of 5 year olds. monosympatomatic nocturnal enuresis is the predominant cause of this. 
- terms
    + enuresis == intermittent nocturnal incontinence (discrete episodes of incontinence during sleep in children <5)
    + monosymptomatic enuresis: enuresis in children without any lower UT symptoms, no history of bladder dysfunction. 
    + nonmonosympatomatic enuresis: other lower urinary tract symptos (eg daytime incontinence, pain, increased frequency)
    + primary enuresis: never achieved dryness for 6 months straight
    + secondary enuresis: children who develop enuresis after a period of 6 months.

# Primary monosymptomatic enuresis
- basics
    + high rate of spontaneous resolution: enuresis is 15% at 5 years, 5% at 10 years. 1-2% > 15 years
- management
    + approach
        * initially @still young is reassurance @spontaneous resolution rate. @social pressures increase @child getting older, can consider desmopressin (short term therapy) and enuresis alarms (most effective long term therapy)
        * aim is to reduce number of wet nights
        * the child should be motivated and be mature enough to do motivational therapy.
        * referral: esp @refractory cases
    + categories
        * education and reassurace
            - based on the high rate of spontaneous resolution
            - must emphasize that it is not the child's fault. should not be punished. actually high rates of punishment == ++anxiety.
            - should use bed protection, disposable products, wash the child before dressing
            - void as much as possible before bed, reduce fluid consumption. 40% morning, 40% afternoon, 20% evening fluid. 
        * motivational therapy
            - sticker/ star chart
        * enuresis alarms
            - most effective long term treatment. take 3-4 months. used for highly motivated children. 
        * desmopressin
            - must determine if short term dryness is a priority - so the child can attend eg. a school camp. this acts as a ADH antagonist.
- initial assessment on history
    + abuse possibility
        * if the parents report that the child is deliberately wetting the bed, consider the possibility of child abuse. OR if the parents express anger.
    + family history   
        * parents may be more concerned @another sibling achieved dryness earlier. 


# Secondary monosymptomatic enuresis
- basics
    + may arise @childhood traua/ anxiety. if this is present, care should be taken to elucidate this and target this. 
    + however is often treated in the same way as primary monosymptomatic enuresis.

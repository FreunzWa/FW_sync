    + CNS infection
    + Osteomyelitis
- manage Dan

- meningitis
    + gentamicin doesnt readily pass the BBB, thus doesnt treat a CNS E coli infection, eg @initially find a urosepsis.

Platelets increased @infection (acute phase reaction)

blood culture already taken, but would need to wait for it come back

admit
admit for IV antibiotics. using broad spectrum: antibiotics, so covering for GPC and GNC. fluclox + gentamicin for GN cover(ceftriaxone not needed @CSF looks fine). wants oto use leess BSAs and it is cheapaer. however now more resistant organisms. 
NGT with breast milk put down it.
IV fluids with glucose 5%, 2/3 @unwell.
monitor vitals hourly

after 48 hours, fever settled, cultures negative and baby is feeding well = stop Abx
then likely a viral infection. ccan still have  neutrophilia with a virus. moves towards lymphocyte predominant later.
blood brain barrier fully developed @3 months

###### Growth 
    most children with slow weight gian/ growth do not have organic illness but must be ruled out.
    growth velocity is the most imporant thing in determining pathological vs. non pathological

# Non pathological causes
- constitutional and familial short stature
    + constitutional    
        * features
            - short stature
            - delayed
            - growth rate slow
            - height age and bone age concordant
            - good prognosis 
            - lack of breast development (lack of tanner stage 2) in girls 13 year old
            - testicular volume <4 ml by age 14
    + familial
        * short
        * not delayed bone growth
        * growth rate normal in familial

# Assessment of growth
- growth charts reported @centiles @easier to communicate. 
- tracking important @can see acceleration/ stunting over time. "following centile". even @following 3rd centile is normal. 
- prepubertally girls and boys very similar, but post puberty boys end avg 13 cm taller than females
- growth velocity curve (most important thing)
    + height velocity (cm/yr) vs. age
    + most rapid phase of growth in first 2 years
    + growth velocity resurge @puberty (girls 1 yr before boys with lower maximum)

# Phases of growth
- infancy
    + nutrition is ++Determinant of growth
- mid childhood
    + linear growth: thyroid hormone and growth hormone determinant. thus growth hormone def may not become apparent until 3-4 @enter the mid childhood phase
- puberty
    + sex hormone production == rapid growth


# Approach to slow growth in mid childhood phase
    !exclude underlying system illness
- exclude illnesses
    + poor nutrition, celiac disease, chronic respiratory conditions (asthma, cystic fibrosis), chronic renal disease, CHD
- pathophysiology of failure to grow due to endocrine abnormality. 
    + cerebral insults/ CP
    +  hypothalamus/ pituitary function
    +  thyroid hormone, IGF-1
        *  hypothyroidism == slow growth rate, dropping height centiles.
        *  growth hormone deficiency (growth hormone def)
        *  cushings syndrome (usu iatrogenic)
    +  function of bone receptors
    +  
- HEI
    + H
        * important psychosocial history (eg neglect)
        * nutrition history
            - when started eating solids, breastfeeding?
            - how much actually eating
            - dietary: inclusion of wheat products? meats?
        * obtain growth charts from birth to determine growth trajectories.
        * recently unwell/ febrile, immunisations
        * mid parental height
        * bowel movements, UO (ensure good detail)
            - bowel movements watery @breast feeding, but @introduce solids == better formed
        * parents' growth patterns and MPH
        * other developmental milestones
        * med conditions, allergies, medications, family history, siblings?
        * birth/ obstetrics
        * napping after meals (wont settle to sleep/ wont sleep for long @hungry so havent eaten enough)
    + E
        * BMI trajectories. <5%, ?failure to thrive
        * WHO growth chart trajectories (w/ previous measurements)
        * height assessment with 90 deg flap with flat feet, hold mandible up. weight to put down hair. shoes off. firm surface.
        * height of parents
        * MPH calculation (correct the 13 cm gap so if child is boy then add 13m to the mother, otherwise -13 cm from the father and then average). 
        * projected final height (should lie +/-7-8 cm of MPH)
    + Investigations
        * Blood

# Pubertal growth
    girl onset 8-14
    boys 9-14
- estrogen is primary driver for growth spurt. precocious puberty common in females (idiopathic causes). however precocious puberty in males ALWAYS due to underlying pathology

# Bone growth
- bone age delayed @
    + constitutional delay, hypothyroidism, glucocorticoid use, GH def, chronic systemi cdisease
- bone age accelerated
    + obesity (@lifestyle), early puberty, hyperthyroidism, androgen excess
- skeletal dysplasia
    + anchondroplasia
    + short stature from birth, track normally


# Nutritional/ intake causes
- inadequate intake
    + poverty, neglect, dentl caries
- micronutrient deficiencies
    + iron def (milk), vitamin D deficiency
- gut malabsorption
    + celiac disease, CF (pancreatic enzyme deficiency), chrons disease

# Investigations
- bloods
    + renal, liver, TSH/T4 relation, IGF1, IGFBP3, iron studies

# Syndromatic causes
- turner, down syndrome assoc with short stature. +other features. 

# Endocrine causes
- growth hormone deficiency
    + usu acquired -- causes a proportional reduction in growth. (head circumfrence, height, weight)
    + serum IGF used to screen


# Concerning features
- <1 percentile
- abnormally short for family height
- abnormal growth velocity
- dysmorphic features (eg Turners)
- signs of chronic illness (more weight loss than height)

# Investigations
- bone aging
- TSH
- IGF-1
- GH/ FSH/ LH/ Testosterone
- CD
- karyotype female
- insulin stimulation / glucagon  test
- general medical issues FBE/ UEC/ ESR 

# Treament
- constitutional
    + male: give T when get to 13-14 years
    + for females, dont give estrogen
- height <1 centile w/ growth velocity for 1 year under 25 centile. with growth hormone deficiency -- give growth hormone. 

# Tall stature
- differentials
    + familial tall syndrome
    + hyperthyroidism
    + precocious 
    + GH secreting tumor
    + Klinefelter's syndrome
    + Marfan's syndrome
    + Beckwith-Widemann syndrome

# Nutrition and normal growth


# Nutrition by stage
- infantile
    + normal weight gain:
        * 0-3 months: 150-200 g/ week
        * 3-6 months: 100-150 g/ week
        * 6-12 months: 70-90g /week
    + recommended:
        * exclusive BF <6 months (4 months at minimum)
            - benefits: -=risk of infection/ DM/ NEC/ GOR, ++neurodevelopment
            - drawbacks: logistically demanding, pain and discomfort, anxiety of having enough milk
        * introduce solids 4-6 months, chewing reflex dev @7-9 months
            - meats @7 months
            - fruit and veg gradually buildup
            - by 12 months can eat modified family meals
        * Avoid bottle feeding beyond 18 months
    + poor feeding
        * common cause of anxiety, but unlikely nutritionally deficient diet @appetite.
        * often snack more and eat less @meals


# Failure to thrive
    <3% for weight or drops 2%iles.
- avoid term FTT with parents (slow growth better)
- ++not @organic cause. 
- @birth weight percentile does not necessarily predict future weight can appear that baby decelerating growth or dropping centiles but actually just attaining normal weight
- HEI
    + H
        * growth patterns of other family members
        * detail on feeding history 
            - intake (what is consumed), when were solids added
            - vomit? 
            - stool consistency and frequency (detail here)
            - weight, gestation, complications
            - past history fo illness/ recurrent infections
            - family ihstory (screen for maternal depression or family strain)
    + E
        * ricketts (bow leg, wide fontanelle, number of teeth)
        * muscle bulk, subcut fat deposites, ankle/ sacral edema
        * hands: clubbing/ koilonychia
        * abdomen: protrusion of abodmen (celiac disease)
- medical
    + etiology
        * prenatal causes:
            - prematurity, maternal malnutrition, toxic exposure in utero, alcohol, smoking, medications, infection, IGUR, Chr Abns
        * post natal causes (3)
            - poor absorption
                + Anatomical GI abn, malabsorption, Pancreatic condition, inborn errors of metabolism
            - inadequate intake
                + vomiting
                + GI pain/ dysmotility
                + low appetite/ chronic illness
                + inability to suck/ swallowing issues
            - increased metabolic demand
                + HIV
                + Malignancy
                + Renal failure
                + Thyroid disease
                + Cardiopulmonary/ inflammatory disease
        * non organic causes
            - poverty, neglect, difficult child
- investigations
    + FBE and film (microcytic aneamia @iron deficiency)
        * Iron studies and ferritin
    + Vit B12, folate, Zinc, selemium
    + Sweat chloride levels (CF)
    + Urine culture/ urinalysis
    + creatinein, electrolytes
    + ESR (raised @IBD)
    + Stool cultures (ova, cysts, parasites)
    + Celiac screen
    + Mantoux test (immunity to TB)

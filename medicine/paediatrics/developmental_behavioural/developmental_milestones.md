###### Child developmenta and disability
    3-5% chldren have dev delay @least mild-moderate. usu undiagnosed. must determine child's development abnormal for age through comparison to population means and family. 



# Investigations into development
- Informal clinical judgement - mostly unreliable.
- PEDS (parents evaluation of devleopmental status) used @primary care setting 10 q aimed to detemrine parental concern. birth - 8 years
- Formal screening - discrimination into PROBABLY DOES and PROBABLY DOES NOT. @fails == refer to formal assessment

# Approach to initial history for parent with concern
- H
    + cardinals (time, severity, regression?)
    + associated: socialising, motor development, fine motor development, languages
    + basics: bowel movements, recent illness, feeding, - diet. weight gain, behaviour (playful, tired etc.), sleep
    + med history: hearing loss (hearing ever assessed), previous hospitalisations, ADHD, depression, epilepsy
    + obs course (premature baby, low birth weight)
    + comparison to other family members
    + vaccinations, allergies.
- E
    + inspection of how child behaves interacts, plays, 
- I



# General management principles
- referral to education/ support services:
    + speech therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy

# Walking
    12-18 months normal range for independent walking. @>18 start worry @rule out causes
[cruising; when children walk and hold onto furniture in order to move around the room, cannot walk independent of supports]
- diagnoses to exclude @delayed walking
- HEI
    + other developmental milestones 4 domains: (eg sitting erect, head lifting, crawling, playing, speaking, socialising)
        * eg speech/ language in detail.
    + breech position, clicky hips, obstetrics
    + details of walking (eg using both legs equally), how often given opportunity to walk, attempts to walk? 
    + comparisons to other siblings
    + growth, head circ, height and weight
    + vision, hearing (tested? - newborn hearing screening test?), vestibular function
    + recently sick, past illnesses
- E
    + visualise TM (effusions?)
- I
    + tympanometry: elasticity of the TM. raised vs. flat pattern.
        * @fluid behind ear == cannot move
        * eusatchian tube dysfunction
    + audiometry testing:
    + hip Xray (hip dysplasia)

# Management
- reassurance and support
    + 



# Speech development
- education
    + stories, positive words, eye contact, speak clearly, point and look at things, observations

###### Enuresis
    primary: no >6 month history of dryness
    secondary: >6 month history of dryness at some stage, now enuresis has recurred
    monosymptomatic vs. polysymptomatic
    usu only commence treatment like bed alarms beyond 7 yrs old
    can do a  urinalysis with dipstick as a baseline (just for leuks/ nitraites/ glucose dipstick)
    refer to graph for proportion of children still wetting the bed.

# Approach
- time course
    + just during the night? any during the day?
        * @during the day == UI instead
- associated
    + constipation (treat this first before proceeding)
    + snoring /sleep apnoea
    + fever
    + features of sleep apnoea (pauses in breathing/ grunting/ snoring)
- urinary symptoms
    + UTI, increased thirst, burning pain
- relieving
    + use nappies other barriers?
- red flags
    + dry for 6 months or more == red flag 
- triggers/ social factors
    + ask for divorce, moved home, started new school etc. camps, social 
- social effect
    + eg sleepovers, school camps
- developmental
    + happy with development
    + weight and growth
- Med history:
    + T1DM
    + recurrent UTIs
    + psychological issues/ trauma
- FHx   
    + family history of diabetes/ T1DM, personal history
    + nocturnal enuresis has a strong genetic componetn (either parent having similar issues when they were young)

# Examination 
- LL reflexes/ sensation
- examine lower back

# Investigation
- consider urinalysis @ any:
    + bedwetting started @last few days - weeks
    + daytime symptoms
    + signs of illness
    + history of UTI
    + history of DM

# Management
- watch and wait (especially @<10)
- recording
- before bed routine (reduce fluid intake/ -=caffeine and other diuretics/ ensure child is encouraged to clean everythign and change sheets themselves).
    + try to get all fluids by 4 PM
- stop using nappies afterceratin point to encourage 
- own bed/ bedroom
- Gold standard - bed and pad alarm: not suitable @the carer expressing anger/ blame towarsd child
    + usu takes 6-8 weeks
    + generally recommended @>7
- pharma
    + desmopressin @needed for short periods (called minirin melts)
    + only for refractory/ fail bell and pad (eg contra @autistic - may be scared by alarm)
    + risk of fluid overload - so fluid restrict when giving this

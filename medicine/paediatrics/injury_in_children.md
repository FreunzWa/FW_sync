###### Injury in children

# Head injury
    most are minor
    always consider non accidental injury esep @infants
- assessment
    + AVPU scale to assess consciousness
    + secondary survey (additional skull fractures, signs of fractured base of skull -- haemotympanum, racoon eyes, battles sign). follow up GCS scores
    + get a glucose
- investigation
    + any base of skul fracture signs == CT
    + focal neurology
    + GCS <8
    + suspicion of open/ depressed skull fracutre
    + GCS persistenyl <13
    + suspected NAI
    + any seizure that occurs more than 2 minutes after impact
- treatment
    + @trivial: D/C, analgesia and discharge advice
    + concussion: GCS13-15. other mild signs (headache, vvomiting, drowsiness, TLOC> 5 seconds). observed for 6 hours. D/C home @tolerate oral fluids + return to baseline. analgesia. %anti-emetics
    + moderate: GCS 9-12. consult senior doctor
    + severe: GCS <8 OR focal neurology OR base of skull OR ICP rise.  maintain ABCDS, avoid rise @ICP. CT spine and CT c-spine. c-spine immobilisation. @concerning features: GCs<8 perisstnely, loss of laryngeal reflex == intubate. maintain 30 degrees hjead up. ventilate to a PaCO2 of 35-40 mmHg. consider hypertonic saline to prevent cerebral edema.
- advice
    + concerning features:
        * vomit more than once
        * seizures
        * foreign body or persistent bleeding
        * visual disturbvance
        * unequally sized pupils
        * not cry after knock to head
        * be dazed/ shocked
        * drowsy/ not repsonding to voice.
        * TLOC
        * bleeding / discharge from ear or nose.
        * slurred speech
        * unusual . confused behaviour
    + cognitive fatigue @after head injury == allow rest.


# Fractures
- buckle injury distal radius
    + metaphyseal region of distal radius compression fracture. usu @FOOSH
    + features: pain/ tenderness over distal radius. minor swelling. no deformity. wrist may be able to bee moved.
    + wrist X-ray or @poorly localised == forearm x-ray
    + stable. dont need referral to ortho. use fibrglass/ below elbow backslab or a removable wrist splint for 3 weeks
    + no followup needed.
    + just remove backslab in 3 weeks
- supracondylar fractures
    + either extension (displaced post) or flexion (distal frag displaced ant)
    + peak 5-8
    + FOOSH
    + pain + swelling + limited ROM
    + type 2 and 3 require rduction.
    + above elbow backslab and sling
    + followup GP 3 weeks for type 1. 
    + type 2 == fracture clinic 1 week after
    + type
- referring to ortho    
    + @neurovascular compromise. 
    + cannot achieve acceptable reduction
    + open fracture or impending (large bruise/ tenting of the skin)

###### Epilepsy and seizures
    5% children will have a seizure, usu fairly benign (eg @fever -- febrile convulsions), most common @<6 months @developing brain
    epilepsy prevalence is 0.5%, prevalance highest in infancy @CNS immaturity, but actually then increases later iin life.
[epilespy; definition: recurrent 2+ unprovoked seizures @genettic predisposition]
[epileptic seizures; abnormal excessive hypersynchronous activity from neurons in the cerebral cortex. clinical, electrical and neurochemical manifestations]
[non epileptic 'seizures']
[focal seizures; can become generalised secondarily, categorised @complex partial/ simple partial seizures dependingn on whether consciousness is affectted.]
[generalised seizures; always complex @consciousness is going to be imapired @whole brain affected]
[automatism; doing something without any consciousness of performing action]
[cataplexy; sudden muscle weakness - immediately going into REM sleep and losing muslce tone]

# Epilepsy
- 2+ unprovoked recurrent siezures
- causes   
    + genetic epilepsies (primary/ idiopathic) 
        * age dependent onset, very characteristic patterns on EEG, very good prognosis 
        * polygenic are the most common, esp Ca2+, Na+ channels.
    + structural/ metabolic epilepsies (symptomaic/ secondary)
        * usu @structural problems underlyhing egb trauma, infection, HIE, tumor
        * variable EEG patterns on abnormal backgrounds
        * usu diagnosed @MRI

# Epilepsy, classification 
- generalised
    + idiopathic
    + epileptic encephalopathies
- focal
    + benign (idiopathic)
    + symptomatic (lesional)

# Types of seizures
- based on location in brain of seizure onset
    + generalised
    + focal seizure
- generalised seizures (may be secondary to a focal seizure)
    + tonic clonic
    + absence
    + myoclonic
    + tonic 
    + atonic "drop attacks"
    + spasms
- focal seizures "partial seizures"
    + simple partial seizures
        * motor
        * somatosensory
        * visual
        * autonomic
        * dysphasic
    + complex partial seizures
        * dyscognitive (complex partial - where consciousness is impaired), may include other simple sensory modalities affected

# Clinical manifestations of various types of seizures
- jerking contractions
- staring episodes, being unreposnive
- collapsing episodes

# Differential diagnosis (other than seizure)
+ normal phenomenon
    * sleep jerks, tantrums, day dreaming and innattention
+ syncope
    * vasovagal atttacks/ syncope eg @valsalva, breath holdiing spells, long QT syndrome, stretch syncope, arrhythmia
+ parasomnias
    * confusional arousals, night terrors, sleep walking ,cataplexy
+ migraiine variants
    * compliocataed migraine, BPPV, TIAs
+ movement disorders
    * tics, clonus, chorea, tremor
+ behavioural
    * manneerisms, psychogenic, rage attacks

# Approach
- most important to rule out serious reversible caues eg meningitis before considering epilepsy
- determine if definitely seizure, then what type of seizure it is. eg focal or generalised.
- H
    + cardinal features, BDA
    + remember anything about the seizure eg any sensatin/ aura. @can remember something about seizure must have had focal onset.
    + history of other minor events eg staring/ little jerks
    + 
- E
    + 
- I
    + home video, EEG monitoring (done after 2nd afebrile seizure to confirm diagnosis of epilepsy)
    + @recurrent = MRI

# Further detail on types of seizures

# Tonic clonic seizure
- seizure with fast contracting and slow contracting phase with relaxation

# Myoclonic seeizures
- 

# Absence seizures
- staring episodes, unresponsive, brief attacks and are very frequent
- often precipitated by hyperventilation
- myoclonus

# EEG

# Seizure syndromes (more detail on the above classification schema)
- idioipathic generalised epilepsies
    + benign familial neonatal epilespy
    + seevere mycolonic epilepsy (dravet syndrome)
    + generalised epilepsy with FS+
    + myoclonic atonic epilepsy (doose syndrome)
    + childhood absevce epilespy
    + juvenile absence epilepsy
    + GGE with GTCS in sleep/ on walking
    + juvenile myoclonic epilepsy
    + photosensitive epilepsy
- symptomatic generalised (epileptic encephalopathies)
    + Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 
        * (Ohtahara syndrome OS): @structural brain abnormality with atrophy == severe intellectual disabilitiies, intractable seizures, rare, tonic clonic seizure onset occuring <3 months esp <10 days. %partial /myoclonic seizures. EEG characterised "burst suppression" pattern (high voltage spike then low brain activity)
    + West syndrome (infantile spasms)
        * rare. many differet names. diagnose @2 of 3 in triad (hypsarrhythmia on EEG, developmental regression, infantile spasms)
    + Lennox gastaut syndrome
- benign focal 
    + benign infantile convulsions
    + benign rolandic epilepsy with CTS
    + benign occipital epilepsy early and late
    + epilepstic aphasia syndromes (LKS)
    + adnfle
    + familial TLE
    + reflex focal epilepsies
- symptomatic lesional epilepsies
    + medial tle (hs)
    + lesional TLE, FLE, PLE, OLE
    + multilobar/ hemispheric epilepsies
    + gelastic epilpsy with HH
    + hemiplegia hemiconvulsion
    + chronic encephalitis (rasmussen)

# Febrile convulsions
    @fever without any seriosu medical issue == seizure usu lasts for fewee minutes. 
    very common and usu benign.
- medical
    + mx
    + assoc
        * tiny increased risk of epilespy, not significant for a simple FC
        * increased risk of more febrile seizures (1/3 rate of recurrence.)
    + rf
        * high fever (peak rather than rate of rise is more of a risk)
        * hyponatremia
        * viral infections esp influenza and HHV (bac less frequent)
- diagnosis
    + rule out other causes for seizure (mass lesions, CNS infection, metabolic derangement)
    + no previous history of seizures occurring without fever! 
    + class
        * simple febrile seizures: generalised seizures <15 mins and not recurring within 24 hours.
        * complex febrile seizures: focal/ prolonged/ multiple within first 24 hours 
        * febrile status epilepticus: continuous seizures wwithout neuro recovery for 30 mins +. 
- clinical 
    + H
        * ++@<5 yrs old, >6 months.
        * <15 minutes lasting tonic clonic convulsion, but usually lasts within 5 minutes
- investigations
    + @drowsy/ sedated mental state or other signs of meningitis eg petechial rash/ nuchal rigidity == take LP. also consider @deficient for Hib or pneumococcal vaccinese.
    + only do UECs if there is a history of vomiting, dairrhoea and abnormal fluid intake or if there are physical findings eg. edema/ dehydration findings.
- rx
    + usu dont need any AEDs or antipyretics. %use benzo @lasting longer than 5 mins.

###### Sore throat
    Most children do not need antibiotics, either caused @gas or virus: difficult to distinguish between viral pharyngitis and GAS pharyngitis. 
    viral pharyngitis will be part of typical coryzal syndrome with odynophagia

# Viral pharyngitis
    
# Group A tonsillopharyngitis
    most common causee of bacterial tonsillopharyngitis in children. 15-30% of total cases. more common @winter
    important to disntguish from viral pharyngitis if can @can then treat to prevent the suppurative  complciations of GAS tonsillopharyngitis, or in high risk individuals. can test with micro culture @absence of viral features and presence of scarlet rash or tonsillar involvement/ erythema of oral mucosa

        * includes viral pharyngitis (more so associated with coryzal features, cough, hoarseness, diarrhoea.). however most reliable way to disintuigh is with rpesence of scarlatiniform rash.

    + antibiotics: Phenoxymethylpenicillin, amoxicillin PO. If oral is not tolerated then BenPen G IM

        * 7 episodes of tonsillities in 1 year
        * or 5 infections/ year for 2 consec years
        * 3 infections/ year for 3 consec years

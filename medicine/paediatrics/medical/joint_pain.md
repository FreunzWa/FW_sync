    transient synovitis
    slipped epihyphysis of femoral
    congenital hip dysplasia
- differentials
    + transient synovitis (pain with walking, difficulty with walking/ crawling, pain in the hip, groin, knee, history of viral illness 1-2 weeks). 3-10 years old. NSAID/paracetamol to relieve pain.

# Transient synovitis

# Perthes syndrome
    rare AVN of femoral head @temporary interruption @lack of blood flow == AVN == stops growing. 
    p/w pain @groin, thigh, hip, @temporary interruption of the 
    bilateral Perthes could be associated with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia
- Avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis
- age range 2-12, but majority 4-8 yrs
- 20% bilateral
- present with pain and limp
- restricted hip motion on examination
- can use an X-ray to see/ MRI @inconclusive
- involve senior doctor
- management: analgesia, reduce loss of hip motion, assess @ortho and intervention when necessary, orthotics may be used after. avoid high impact sports, swimming is recommended. 
- usu self limiting but may leave permanent deformity. 
- best prognosis <6 @more time fo he bone to remodel. >10 ++risk of coxa magna and OA

# Intussussception
    classically intermittent distress, vomiting, lethargy. 
    delayed presentation == bowel obstruction/ perforation 
    classical clinical triad only in  1/3 of children
    most commonly 2m - 2yrs
    usu idiopathic %anatomical risk factors
    counsel - "like a telescope"
- medical 
    + mx
        * invagination of proximawl segment of bowel into distal bowel lumen. esp @ileocaecal valve
        * ==bowel obstruction/ venous congestion and eventually bowel wall ischaemia/ %perforation == peritonitis
    + natural history
        * %self reduced Intussussception
    + rf
        * potential lead point (HSP, lymphoma, peutz-jegher syndrome, Meckels diverticulum)
        * recent bowel surgery
        * recent rotavirus vaccination
- clinical
    + H
        * classical triad (only in 1/3)
            - red currant jelly stool / PR bleeding
            - abdominal pain
            - palpable abdominal mass
        * classically intermittent lethargy / vomiting etc. often recur minutes-hours and iincrease in freq
            - pallor during
            - vomiting
        * may appear veyr well between episodese
        * lethargy (may be episodic or persistent)
        * %bile stained vomiting @bowel obstruction complication

        * sausage shaped mass in the right abdomen-
        * abdo distention (@bowel obstruction)
        * tenderness/ perforation (@peritonitis)
        * inspection of nappy region
        * vitals - unstable may suggest peritonitis/ sepsis %hypovolaemic shock
    + I
        * glucose
        * VBG, FBE, UEC

- rx
    + for a history suggestive of Intussussception
        * analgesia
            - morphine/ fent
        * IV access for fluid resus (for hypovolaemic shock or calcaulated defecit eg @cliunical features of fluid deplete) 20 mk of saline bolus
        * NPO
        * @signs of BO/ perforation == AXR, NGT + Antibiotics (Amoxyl, Gent + Metronidazole)
        * Ultrasound to rule out 
            - @positive == antibiotics + surgical referral. 
        * enenma can be used diagnnostic/ therapeutic for Intussussception
        * %surgery == manipulation fo bowel +/- resection of ischaemic bowel. %laparotomoy/ open @more complex 

# FPIES
    Food Protein Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES) adverse food reaction @infants/ children == enterocolitis == profuse vomiting %diarrhoeae/ letahrgy/ pallor
    usu outgrow FPIES by preschool years
- medical
    + commonn triggers:
        * rice, cow milk and other dairy, soy. 
        * almost any food group can cause FPIES reaction. may get FPIES for multiple foods
- clinical
    + usu profuse vomiting 2-4 hours after ingesting trigger foods
    + after vomiting get diarrhoea for days. 
    + %dehydration
    + FTT @repeat episodes
- rx
    + avoidance of trigger foods
        * extensively hydrolysed formula for cow milk/ soy allergies (eHF)
    + treat dehydration
        * IV replacement + defecits @ongoing diarrhoea etc.
    + supervised food challenge
        * to determine @grown out


# Mesenteric adenitis
    inflamm of lymph nodes esp @RLQ abomdinal pain
    key differential for appendicitis or acute abdominal pain
    common under 16 years, much less common @adults

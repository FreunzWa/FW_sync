- basics
    + common in children. most bowel action once 2-3 days at least. @baby infrequent @breast feed (at least 1 per week)
    + %young children ignore teh urge to defecate == large build up of actions. 
    + may ignore @painful defecation == retention == cycle
    + more common @introduction of solid foods/ toilet training
- assessment
    + H
        * consistency (soft-hard, small nuggets vs. liquid)
        * straining
        * blood on wiping/ in the nappy
        * past medication use to treat
        * toilet refusal or other withoodling behaviours (crossing legs)
        * incontince (urinary or fecal - classify day vs. night). faecal incontinence may be @overflow incontience @impacted faecal mass
        * FHx: celiac disaese
    + Red flags:
        * <6 weeks
        * delayed passage of meconium (Hirschsprung)
        * ribbon like stools (anorectal malformation)
        * FTT/ weight loss/ PR blood loss
        * abdominal mass (that is not a faecal mass)
    + E
        * faecal mass in LLQ
        * lower spine (NTDs)
        * lower limb neruology, assess giat + reflexes
        * perianal area (Fissures, anal wink/ tone, placement of the anus)
- Rx
    + non pharma
        * behaviour
            - knees higher than hips, lean forward - elbow on knees
            - toileting positivie experience - dont stress the child. 
            - TIMED TOILETING: 5 mins after eating - can do toilet sits after meals 3 times per day with a timer. time so that optimise the gastro-colic reflex.
            - chart/ diary to reinforce positive behaviour
            - ensuring activity in the child
        * diet
            - excessive cow milk may exacerbate
            - ensure balanced diet: fluid, encourage fruits and vegetables
    + pharma
        * stool softeners: months-years use osmotic/ lubricant laxatives. "dont think of it as a drug, just something that draws water into the bowel"
        * titrate to 1 soft bowel motion per day
        * Options
            - infants <1 months: coloxyl drops
            - infants 1-12 months: iso-osmotic laxative/ lactulose
            - chilren: paraffin oil or movicol/ osmolax
    + rx for disimpaction
        * outpatient: sachets movicol or osmolax scoops
        * inpatient: NGT macrogol/ electrolyte solutions

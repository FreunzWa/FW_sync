# Counselling for Nasonex topical corticosteroid spray (mometasone)
- check if working
    + priming: press until fine mist
- clear nose
    + gently blow nose to clear nostrils
- shake nasal spray gently
- remove the cap
- hold spray upright, thumb beneath bottle, finger aside nozzle
- tilt head forward
- close the other nostril
- point the cap outwards, not towards the midline but needs to go in direction of corner of eye
- inhale as you squeeze (may do this twice @asked to repeat)
- then breathe out
- repeat for the other nostril 
- then clean the applicator after
- check patient understanding: get them to demonstrate how they would do it, and clarify any steps
- pitfalls:
    + not priming
    + skipping doses
    + head must be forward
    + dont put nozzle in to far
    + dont sniff too hard

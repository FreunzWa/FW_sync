# Counselling
    assessing the function of your lungs
    measuring amount of air you can blow out, and how fast you can blow it out
    get you to deep breaths, you may feel a bit dizzy
    nose peg on the nose to ensure all air going out through the mouth
- teeth and lips over the nozzle
- deep breath in, then put the nozzle in, then blow as hard and as fast as you can for as long as you can
- at least 3 blows, need 2+ that are consistent
- had any puffers today (would note down when they took the puffers)
- coach the patient to keep blowing and then breathe in as raidly as possible (the machine may also record the inspiration component as well)
- repeat until have 2+ consistent, when ready continue

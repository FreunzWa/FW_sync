###### Painful scrotum

# Acute scrotum
    Testicular torsion
    Torsion of Morgagni
[mesorchium; mesentery - the peritoneal attachment of the testis inside the tunica vaginalis]
[Hydatid of morgagni; testicular appendage which %gets torted. present in 80% of normal boys. tortion risk @10-11 years @estrogen surge when it enlarges.]
- rf
    + 10 years mean age, prepubescent more common
    + %perinatal testicular torsion.
- medical
    + causes
        * usu @underlying bell clapper deformity of extension of tunica vaginalis (aka mesorchium) == freely moveable testicle == spermatic cord can wrap == ischaemia
        * %@appendix testis (90% have it), attached to the tunica vaginalis. %the causeof testicular torsion. called "Torsion of Hydatid Morgagni" - the appendix testis
    + mx
        * @spermatic cord compression == distal ischaemia. 
        * pathology limited to hemiscrotum @scrotum in 2 separate peritoneal compartemnts
    * complications
        - @testicular torsion == testis loss (infertility risk @other has BC deformity)
        - @hydatid of morgagni torsion == no risk to testis (self limiting resoprtion)
- clinical
    + presentation
        * pw/ quandrant abdominal pain @referred
        * inflamed hemiscrotum, enlarged, erythematous, painful/ tender
        * in torsion of hydatid of morgagni == red painful hemiscortum with blue pea.
        * normally testicle is same size as the glans penis prepubescent.
- rx
    + requires immediate surgery, no time for ultrasound. scrotal exploration. 
    + usu bil bell clapper defomity == need to do surgery on both sides. 
    + @already infarcted == still do surgery to correct other (must do this) and confirm diagnosis.s
    + for perinatal red hemiscrotum needs US to diff tumor from torsion (dont need to fix the other side, but %done anyway)
- differentials
    + idiopathic scrotal edema (inflammation spreads to both sides)

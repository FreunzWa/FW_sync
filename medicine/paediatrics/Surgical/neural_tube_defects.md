###### Neural tube defects
    Open NTD @CNS exposed through a defect in the skull or vertabrae
    Closed NTDs occur when the spinal defect is covered @skin
- types 
    + OPEN NTDs
        * anencephaly
        * encephalocele
        * hydranaecephaly
        * iniencephaly
        * schizencephaly
        * spina bifida
    + Closed NTDs
        * lipomyelomeningocele
        * tethered cord
        * lipomeningocele

# NTDs in general
- rf
    + previous child with NTD (4% chance of next child with NTDs)
    + insufficent folate
    + teratogen exposure (AEDs)s, obesity/ diabetes (x2 risk)
- ix
    + US
    + AFP (will not detect SBO)
    + 

### Open NTDs

# Encephalocele
- protrusion of brain and meninges @deficiencies in the sskull @failure of netural tube closure. 
- ++accompanied @other craniofacial abnormalities
- assoc with microcephly, spstic quadriplegia, ataxia
- clinical
    + usu obvious abnormality, but %small == mental and developmentl delays
- rf
    + exposure to tertagoens and insufficient folate
- rx
    + requires surgery @infancy. reparation of hiatus in skull
    + %shunts are inserted to drain excess CSF fluid form the brain

# Spina bifida
    Spina bifida occulta
    meningocele
    myeloeningocele
- @unfused spinal column == spinal cord membranes and %nerves can herniate out.
- usu lumbrosacral
- diff
    + spina bifida occulta
        * no symptoms, %have dark hairy patch, dark spot/ swelling at the back at site of gap @spine.
        * actually very common ~15% of people (most get incidental diagnosis) -- no rel to back pain. very small opening in vertebrae
        * not associated with increased AFP
    + meningocele
        * mild problems, with a sac of fluid poking out of vertebrae (covered @meninges) but no nerves. 
    + myeloeningocele (MMC)
        * most severe; downstream neurons affected == incontinence/ hydrocephalus/ tethered cord/ latex allergy
        * clinical
            - protrusion of nerves/ mass @lumbrosacral area
            - %associated with natal cleft agenesis (@insufficient myogenesis distal to lesion)
        * rarer @antenatal diagnosis == termination @severe outcomes.
        * various teratogens can cause (Ca blockers, AEDs, valproate)
        * myeloeningocele + myelocele
            - most severe form of MMC, @no overlying membrane == risk of infection meningitis. total paralysis distal to lesion.
- most common @lower back, %middle back/ neck

###### Abnormal genitalia
[processus vaginalis; development outpouching of paiertal peritoneum, starts 12 week and gives rise to tunica vaginalis when proximal part is obliterated and resorbed.]

------
# Approach to swollen scrotum
    Testicular torsion
    Blunt trauma to scrotum
    Hydrocele
    Tumor of testis
    Inguinal hernia




# Cryptorchidism (UDT)
- failure of testicular descent == lack of testicle in scrotum. testicle usu in groin outside inguinal, and is palpable. @in the inguinal canal is not palpable
- more common @preterm, %will migrate within 1 year
- types
    + groin testicle
    + inguinal canal testicle
- acquired:
    + many develop acquired UDT after infancy == later presentation (due to failure of spermatic cord increase size).
    + usu spermatic cord only 5 cm , should be 10 cm. 
    + failure of spermatic cord grow @failure to resorb the processus vaginalis.

# Ectopic testis
- uncommon
- differential for periscrotal mass

# Hydrocele
- mx
    + @intraperitoneal fluid tracks down PV
- clinical
    + transillumination == see shadow of normal testis inside
    + cannot compress it to empty it quickly because the opening is small 
    + can get above the swelling @no bowel within
- differential
    + hernia with contained omentum

# Inguinal hernia in babies
- an emergency in babies
- rf
    + more common @male. 
- medical
    + complications
        * high risk of strangulation/ incarc for babies

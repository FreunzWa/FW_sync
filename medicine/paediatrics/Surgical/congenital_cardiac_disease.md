###### Congenital cardiac disease
    0.8% of live births have a congenital cardiac diseaase

# Causes
    VSD 25-30%
    ASD 7%
    PDA 7%
    Coarctation of the aorta 7%
    TOF 7%
    Pulmonary valve stenosis 7%
    Aortic valve stenosis 7%


# Left to rigght shunt cardiac diseases
- heightened pulmonary blood flow @left to right shunt == more volume int eh right side of teh heart. 
- clinical
    + ==tachypnoea, recession, failure to thrive
- types
    + VSD
        * most common, 30% of CHD. variable haeomdynamic effect basaed on size.
        * SMall VSD
            - pansystoilic LLSE, difficult to hear early @++PVR @birth. 
            - loud murmur @small size of VSD (eq of continuity == more turbulence)
            - murmur emerges once teh PVR falls
            - no haeomdynamic effects
        * Large VSD
            - symptoms emerge as teh PVR falls over 1-3 weeks
            - usu require surge unless reducee spont in size
            - eisenmenger complex: pulmonary hypertension 2nd to VSD (eventually causinig right to left shunt). assoc with T21
        * VSD location
            - perimembranouss
            - muscular (high chance of spont closure, but difficult to close surge)
            - doubly committed
                + ++risk of AV regugitation
        * VSD investigation
            - TTE
                + numebr and locatiton
                + estimateion of pressure gradient and assess RV function and pressure
                +

###### Common respiratory conditions in children
    @young == get 6-12 infx per yeaer. usu cough <3 weeks, @longer == must rule out other causes.
    asthma usu not present with cough
    URTI is the most common cause, self limtiing and does not need treatment.

# Approach to wheezing child
    common pres @young, 20% infants wheeze, 40% children under 6 have at least 1 wheezing episode. 

# Approach to Persistent Cough
    Whooping Cough (time course and presence of cough fits)
    Viral URTI/ Common Cold (absence of concerning/ onset) -- <3 weeks cough

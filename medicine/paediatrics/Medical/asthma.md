###### Asthma


# Acute asthma assessment and management
    @reversible airways obstruction and bronchospasm. 
    ++@viral infection == exacerbation
    asthma more difficult to diagnose @<5 yrs, trial salbutamol. asthma more common after 5 
    Wheezing is very common @babies/ toddlers however not all develop asthma. 
    25% diagnosed @asthma at some point.
[minimal handling; @sick child deteriorates with handdlinng and distressing procedures == keep child with parennt/ carer, keep environmennt quiet. very important in severe croup and asthma. -- eg dont force a posture @children will naturally adopt posutre suits airway best.]
[IPPV; intermittent positivee pressure ventilation]
[NFA; near fatal asthma]
- medical
    + complications of treatment
        * @++salbutamol use IV/ inhaled == hypokalemia risk @drawn into cells (monitor K+). consider adding KCl @already on fluids
        * salbutamol toxicity: tachycardia, MA, lactate high
- clinical  
    + H
        * cardinals, past history and existing treatments. triggers? prev episodes and hospitalisationns/ ICU admissions. assess paretnal treamtent of acute episodes.
    + E
        * ability to talk, FTT, mental status
        * wheeze intensity is not reliable. @low wheeze == could be heralding imminent respiratory collapse.
        * work of breathing /hyperinflation/ recession
        * SpO2
        * consider oral pred
    - I
        + dont need a VBG/ ABG/ CXR
        + %UEC for K+ @salb toxicity.
- differnetials
    + inhaled foreign body
- management
    + ACUTE
        + mild (normal mental state, subtle/ no increased work of breathing/ able to talk)
            * salbutamaol MDI/ spacer. give 1 dose and review in 20 minutes.
        + moderate (some mild limitation in ability to talk or poor resposne to mild treatment)
            * o2 @<90% -- dont give oxygen for just increased WOB/ wheeze
            * Salbutamol 1 dose every 20 mins for 1 hr
            * consider oral pred
        + severe (limitation of ability to talk, tachycardi9a, agitated/ distressed)
            * refer to tert/ paeds
            * oxygen @<90%
            * salbumatol @MDI/ spacer 1 dose every 20 mintues for 1 hour. review ongoing requiremnets 10-20 mins after 3rd dose. 
            * Ipratropium bromide @MDI/ spacer 1 dose every 20 minutes for max 1 hour
            * oral prednisolone @vomiting, then give IV methyllpred
            * @poor response to salbutamol/ ipratropium == give Aminophylline
            * Magnesium Sulphate 
            * consider Adrenaline, repearted @5 mins @not improving == lateral thigh 1:1000 
        + critical (child is confused/ drowsy, exhausted, unable to talk, ++RR, silent chest!)
            * PICU.
            * oxygen. 
            * nebulised salbultamol (+monitor for hypokalemia/ toxicity)
            * nebulised ipratropium 
            * methylprednisolone IV
            * aminophylline
            * MgSO4
            * ?IV salbutamol 1:1000, repeat inn 5 minutes
            * Consider Adrenaline
            * PICU respiratory support (facemask CPAP, biPAP, intubation, IPPV, ECMO? but limited evidence)'
    + LONG TERM
        * Asthma Action Plan 
- discharge
    + @1hr after intiitation of treamtenn @clinically well, parents are educated, adequate oral intake, even @mild hypoxia (90-94) can still discharge @clinically well. (there are written criteria for DC)
        * MUST have written action plan (Asthma Action Plan)
        * observe inhaler and spacer technique
        * go to LMO @no improvement within 48 hours
        * all should be followed up with LMO/ paed
- doses for medications
    + salbutamol (1 dose)
        * <6 yrs old: 6 puffs MDI
        * >6 yrs old: 12 puffs MDI
    + ipratropium bromide:
        * <6 yrs; 4 puffs MDI
        * >6 yrs; 8 puffs MDI
    + oral prednisolone
        * 2 mg/kg


# Asthma Action Plan
     in easy access place
- prevention
    + avoid triggers!
    + keep eczema and hay fever under control!
- during an acute episode
    + sit child comfortable + remain calm at all times
    + shake blue reliever puffer == give 4 separate puffs + USE a space if possible. for each puff == 4 breaths. then wait 4 mins and repeat the 4 breaths. 
    + If not improved after the two lots of 4 puffs then call ambulance. 
    + While waiting, continuously repeat steps 2 and 3. 
- Ongoing
    + Preventer @needed, every day.

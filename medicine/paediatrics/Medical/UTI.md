###### UTI
    non specific signs / symptoms of UTI in young children, overlap with other viral illness.
    urine dipstick ONLY for screening, require urine culture with pyuria
    oral Abx for most, unless serioussly unwell or <3 months
    seriously unwell children or <3months need renal tract US to exclude an obstruction prior to discharge

# H
- previous UTIs?
- older children may have more focal symptoms (dysuria? frequency? lower abdominal and loin pain?)
- infants and pre-verbals have non specific features eg fever, vomiting, poor feeding, lethargy, irritability

# E
- %normal, %lkower abdominal/ loin pain
- %dehydration and lethargy 

# Severity assessment
- lower and upper UTI distinction difficult @young
- however pyelonephritis suggested @systemic features: fever, maaise, vomiting and loin tenderness
- cystitis more local urinary features, easier to elucidate @older

# Ix
- urine sample collected + dipstick and MCS, culture reesults ready 24 hours
- urine sample prior to abx unless unwell and needs immediate IV
- smaple 
    + Older children: MSU (contamination 25%)
    + Young children: clean catch after perineal cleanning.  @seriously unwell, use a catheter of an SPA
        * SPA contamination rate 1%
        * in out catheter useful @low urine in bladder. contamiantion 10%, discard first fewe drops.
    + do NOT use bag urine @contaminataion 50%
- dipstick
    + screening tooll only, leuks and nitrites suggestive. less reliable @young @false Negatives
        * However Nitrites not produced by all organisms == does not exclude UTI. esp @leuks positive then take better sample. However @leuks does not confirm UTI so do other febrile illlness investigations.
- urine MCS
    + squams suggest contimation == take agian
    + positiver culture! with pyuria is diagnostic.c
        * note that blood annd protein, and pyuria are not diagnostic, need culture of organism for diagnosis.
    + growth of orgnamism 10^8 per litre == infection
    + growth of organism 10^6-10^8 suggests infection/  earrly infectgion
    + growth of any amount from SPA == likely infection
- Other investigatgions
    + renal function UEC + US @seriously uinwell or not responding after 48 hours
    + %do other inveestigations for different focus eg LP
- Follow up
    + Renal tract US @<3months or seriously unwell priot to discharge
        * vesico-ureteric reflux
        * posterior urethral valve= = causes significant obstruction and UTI risk. however now more normally picked up @pernatal scan.
    + @recurrent UTIs == should do Renal US anmd organise specialist followup
    + dont need prophylaxis
    

# Rx
    Po abx usu
    any serious unwell or at risk == IV Abx + admission
    shorter course (3-7) for cystitis, longer for PN
- PO treatment
    + Trimethoprim 4mk BD max 150mgg OR Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (8mg/40mg per ml) 0.5ml/kg (max 20ml) BD (should be avoided in infants < 6 weeks old) OR Caphelexin 25 mk max 500mg tds
- IV treatment @seriouslyl unwell, pyelo expectede. dont do urine sample first
    + gentamicin + benzylpenicillin. 
    + @continuing gent beyond 48 hours, check renal function annd get gentamicin levels. 
    + switch to PO @improved
- DC:
    + @tolerating oral fluids and oral antibiotics

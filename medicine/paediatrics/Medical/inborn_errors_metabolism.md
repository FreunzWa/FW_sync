###### Inborn errors of metabolism
    aka congenital metabolic disesases OR inherited metabolic disorders.
    genetic diseases w/ congenital disorders of metabolism usu @single gene conding for enzymes == toxic accumulation
    IEM term was originally coined 1908, has been superceded by more modern terms as above.

# Categories
    usu fit into carb, amino acid, organic acid, lysosomal storage diseeases, steroid, mitochondrial function, peroxisomal function, porphyrinn metabolism amongst others.
    


# Alkaptonuuria



# Phenylkenoturia
    1 in 10^4 in european populations. less @others.
- medical
    + AR conditino == deficienncy of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) == cannot convert phenyylalanine to tyrosine == accumulation nof phenyylalanine in the brain == txic damage. @not detected and treated == severe IQ disability. treat @low phenyylalanine diet.
    + screening done == clincal manifesetations of PKU rare.
    + mx
        * PAH converts Phenylalanine to Ty. this pathway provides 75% catabolism of PA == elevated PA in tissue annd urinary concentrations. Tyrosine usu in normal range but %low. BH4 cofactor
    + etiology
        * ++@low PAH enzyme levels but %@defects in BH4 metabolism
    + complications
        * irreversible IQ disability (unknown exact but likely @toxic metabolic local effect in brain and abn development of neurons)
        * mild IQ disability @frontal lobe toxcitiy even seen @strict PA low diet.
- class
    + classic PKU ((complete enzyme deficiency)
    + moderate PKU (some residual PAH)
    + mild PKU
    + benign mild PKU
- clinical
    + asymptomatic prior to commence feeds (both breast milk and standard formula contain PA)
    + @untreatede == seizures, severe IQ disability, skinn disease, behavioural abnormalities.
    + even @good dietary controol == mild toxicityin frontal lobe.
    + subclinical vcisual impairment.
- Ix
    + diagnosis made @elevated PA serum
- Rx
    + multidisciplinary team
    + dietary restriction of PA
        * PA free protein substitutes, however issues with compliance. however requires strict adherence throughout life.
        * GMP supplemented foods (glycomacropeptides -- naturall fouind in cheese that contains tiny amounnt of PA)
        * PA free formula feeding. 
        * breast milk limitations (about 25% of feeds but %totally eliminate @severe). restriction of maternal diet tdoes not help
    + pharmacotherapy
        * synthetic BH4 fomrulation (sapropterin), may help slighyl as shows a mild decrease in serum PA. used as an adjunct to dietary reestriction.
        * recombinannt PAL == degrades PA, still in research 
    + monitorign
        * blood conc of PA monitored frequently, esp @young. weekly intervals inn tehe first year, then decreasing. monthly after 12 years of age.

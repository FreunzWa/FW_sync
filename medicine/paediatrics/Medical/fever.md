###### Child with a fever
    fever >38 celsius, important indicator for futher asessment esp @neonate. decreased rates @vaccination esp @pneumo vaccine.
    Foci to consider: pneumonia, meningitis, bone and joint innfectionns,  SSTIs, mastoiditis, bacteraemia.
[SBI; serious bacterial infection. SBIs without a clear focus are ++@UTIs]

# Features of seriously unwell child
- isolated pallor, poor feeding or decreased acitvity on their own may not necessarily suggeset seriosuly unwell child

# H
    also other features of hypothermia or temperature instabilit can also indicate serious infection or other illness.
- travel history
- sick contacts (other family members, day care or school)
- IUTD? 
- medication (prior treatment with abx may mask signns of bacterial infection)
- high risk (ATSI, central line, CCF, previous invasive bacterial infections, prematurity history, immunosuppression)
- severity not reliable ascertained @degree of fever, rapidity of onset and the presence of simple febrile convulsions which are generally benign.

# E
    take not that isolated lethargy, pallor or poor feeding may not suggest seriously unwell child
- color (pallor, mottled, blue/cyanosed)
- activity (lethargy OR decreased activity)
- respiratory (grunting, tachypnoea, increased WOB, Saturations)
- temperature taken from same location
    + < 3months: axillary
    + tympanic: >3 months
    + rectal temp in neonates @axillary showed non fever but fever still clinically suspecteed
- Circulation/ Huydration (poor feeding, dry mucous, persistent tachya, CRT > 3 seconds, reduced skin turgor, reduced urine output)
- neurologicla
    + bulging fontanelle
    + neck stiffness

# I
    febrile neonates must be urgently evaluated with FBE, inflamm makers, blood, urine annd CSF cultures %with CXR and empiric IV Abx
    Febrile infants <3 months shouuld be investigated based on clinical appeearance. low threshold for investigations
- may find OAM, upper reespiratory symptoms as tthe source of infection, they reequire further investigation for a possible SBI @co-incident infection could mislead.
- LP
    + CANNOT do an LP @impaired conscious state/ focal neurological signs or haemodynamic inmstability or impaired coagulation == just comemnce empiric treatem ntf or meningitis

# Management
- admit @febrille chidl @looks unwell == investigate appropriately. 
- @stable generally complete investigataions bnefopre starting abx
- management differs @<28, 28-3 months and >3monnths.
- consultaion with local paediatric team (high risk patients, unwell child, sepetic shock, neonates corrected age, advice regarding empiric antibiotics)
- transfer to tert care @exceedinng level of comfort
- always arrange a follow up


# Counselling
- what to do in a fever

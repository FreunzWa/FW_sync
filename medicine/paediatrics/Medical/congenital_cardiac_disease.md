###### Congenital cardiac disease

# Septal defects
- VSD (35% of CHD)
    + ix
        * TTE for location, number and size of VSDs, RVP and LV dilatation
    + rx
        * diuretics 
        * surgical (usu open but catheterisation is emerging + combined)
- ASDs - "Secundum" (10% of CHD)
    + physiological closure of FO @birth @pulmonary pressure
    + usu no sx until 3-4th decade, can cause PTH, heart failure and arrhytmias. 
    + usu just presetn with ejection systolic murmur, %low growth.
    + fixed OR obvious splitting of S2 (as RV is always volume loaded. in inspiration == RV filling but @expiration LV pressure is higher == goes to RV anyway)
    + 95% have rsR'
    + CXR: prominent right atrium and icnreased pulmonary vascularity.
    + rx
        * 80% of small defects will close spontaneously.
        * surgical close @4-5 yrs. very safe surgery.
        * direct closure. 
        * device closure is emerging (catheterisation), device plugging the defect (only for suitable defect shapes)
- PDA (7% of CHD)
    + usu close @first day of life (first 15 hrs usu). 
    + spont closure rare after 2 weeks. (but may close still up until 3 months)
    + continuous murmur
    + @premature == prolonged ventilation requirement
    + pw
        * @small: slow growth and continuous murmur
        * @large: present @4 weeks with v poor growth and tachypnoea. usu only systolic murmur.
    + ix
        * TTE
    + rx
        * indomethacin
        * direct thoracotomy surgery @small sympatomatic infant
        * catheter @large


# Obstructive lesions
- coarctation of the aorta
    + narrowing of aorta  == decreased pulses in femoral/ pop/ post tibial
    + presents 10 days after PDA closure, life threatening with severe downstream ischaemia. gut
    + 50% have associated VSD, mitral valve abns, AS
    + rx    
        * prostin E2 to reopen the DA
        * end to end anastomosis, patch repair
        * catheter +/- stent if recoarctation
    + ix
        * rib notching on CXR


# Valvular lesions
- aortic stenosis
- pulmonary stenosis

# Cyanotic cardiac disease
    Desaturation, require <50 g/L haemoglobin to be clinically apparent. 
    %@CyCD present pink
- Tetralogy of Fallot
    + most common CyCD
    + severity dependent on degree of PS
    + lesions:
        * RV outflow tract obstruction (supra/sub valvular pulmonary stenosis), VSD, overriding aorta, RVH
    + no intervention needed until 6 months
    + assoc with various ChrAbns
    + rx
        * closure of VSD
        * resect right ventricular outflow obstruction
    + complications
        * pulmonary regugrgiation, A/V arrhytmias, right ventircular dilatation and dysfunction
- Transposition of the great arteries
    + most common cause of cyanosis, developes over first day
    + 70% are males
    + lethal condition without treatment
    + have an ASD (PFO) == ++pulmonary blood flow
    + surgery performed in first 2 weeks, 
    + rx
        * arterial switch operation

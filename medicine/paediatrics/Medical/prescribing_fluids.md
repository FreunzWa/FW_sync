###### Prescribing fluids
- @fasting == @low glucose stores == requires ongoing dextrose 5% to avoid hypoglycaemia

# Maintenance fluid
 - 4,2,1 rule for calculating maintenance fluids ml/ kg/ hr

# Clinical assessment
- determining degree of fluid defecity
- weight
    + absolute measure of degree of fluid defecit with before and after weights
- clinical examination  
    + tissue turgor, tachycardia, capillary refill, mucous membranes, saturations, resp effort, history of vomiting/ diarrhoea
- can then predict severity of fluid loss:
    + mild ~4-5%
    + moderate ~6-7%
    + severe (>7%)
- after mild/ moderate/severe is decided fluid provision will be determined

# Delivery of fluid
- nasogastric
    + awlways trial @mild-moderate illness in children 
    + better @decrease risk of infection, electrolyte imbalances
- IV
    + @unwell/ contraindication for NGT (or failed NGT)


# Choice of Fluids
- NGT options
    + breast milk (for use with NGT) if the mother can express
    + ORS - gastrolyte/ hydrolyte (if mother cannot express)
- IV options
    + 0.9% Normal saline + 5% Dextrose
    + Plasmalyte + 5% Dextrose

# Fluids in bronchiolitis
- @mildly unwell == ADH specifically causes resportion and hyponatremia


# Monitoring resopnse to fluids
- input/ output charts and 6 hourly weight
- elecctryolyte measurements only used if IV fluids are in use
    + sodium:   
        * concerned about osmotic demyelination @excessive increase. cutoff 8 mmol/ L increase of serum Na per day. == slow provision of fluid delivry.

###### Electrolytes

# Hyponatremia
    ranges do not vary with age: 
    130-135: mild
    120-129: moderate
    <120   : severe
    acute @<48 hours
    chronic @>4 hours
    most common electrolyte abn @children

- medical
    + etiology
        * iatrogenic
            - haemodilution @fluid esp @hypotonic fluid
            - surgery == ADH release
        * fever/ hypovolaemia/ head injury/ CNS infections/ respiratory disorders == ADH release
    + either hypotonic hyonatremia or hyponatremia without hypotonicity
        * hypotonic hyponatremia 
            - @GI losses == appropriate ADH release in excesso fserum solutes 
            - @respiratory conditions/ CNS infections/ endocrine disorders/ surgeyr/ various drugs == ADH release
            - primary polyipsia == normovolaemia but hyponatremia
            - hypervolaemia @renal failure (cannot excrete free water)
        * hyponatremia without hypotonicity
            - eg @increased tonicity due to urea/ hyperglycaemia, %exogenous solutes eg mannitol/ sorbitol
                + @hyperglycaemia == ++tonicitiy == water from 3rd space == sodium dilution
                + azotemia @renal fialure == %BUN increase. however urea is freely able to cross cell membranes therefore does not act as an osmole
- clinical
    + presentation
    + investigations
        * serum tonicity: 2xNa + glucose mmol/L
- management
    + maintenance fluids only 2/3 of normal calculated amount from 421 rule.

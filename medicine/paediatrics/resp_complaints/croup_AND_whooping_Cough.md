###### Croup and whooping cough
    *whooping cough is a more severe entity specifically caused by bordatella pertussis, currently vaccinated with the DTPa pertussi vaccine, received @2, 4, 6, 12 months and recieves boosters at 4 and 15 years @waning immunity. time course important here. aka 100 day cough @potential for long convalenscent phase.
    *'croup' means "croak", @various usu viral infection @laryngotracheobronchitis. thus mainly upper respiratory tract infection == inflammationa nd obstruction == noisy breathing and cough. the most common cause is human parainfluenza virus. 

    whoop and croup are different sounds, remember distinct entities 


# Whooping cough
    @bordatella pertussis, airborne GN aerobic encapsulated. 
    Clinical Course/ Natual history
    Incubation period (5-10 days), but usu 7-10. contrast with 1-3 incubation of cold
    Catarrhal stage (1-2 weeks), mild prodromal stage w/ cough
    Paroxysmal stage (1-6 weeks)
    Convalescent stage (weeks-months)
[catarrhal phase; prodroma ]
- medical
    + highest risk @<6 months old, high risk of complications (apnoea, severe pneumonia, encephalopathy)
    + rf
        * not IUTD, but can still occur == not as severe.
        * contacts (contagious up to 21 days after onset of cough @untreated)
    + mx
        * BP cannot survive outside body 'fastidious' == only through close airborne contact
        *  bacteria adheres to ciliated resp epithelial cells of URT == stimulates inflammation and breakdown of epithelium == microaspiration of damaged resp cells
    + complications
        * prolonged apnoea/ desaturation/ resp failure
            - mainly @infants <6 months
            - %spotaneously @vagal stimulation
        * rib fracture
        * pulmonary hypetension
        * cardiac failure
        * pneumonia -- high mortality ~80%
            -  == +++WCC, pulmonary hypertension. highest predictor of mortality. intra alveolar hemorrhage and dense leuk infiltrate.
        * seizures/ encephalopathy
        * death
            - usu @<6 months, @not olld enough to have completed pertussis vaccinations.
        * asthma exacerbation @underlying
- clinical
    + H
        * cough/ coryza for one week (catarrhal phase), followed by ++severe paroxysmal cough in phases. 
        * cough usu worse@ night. 
        * %fever
        * %present as non-specific persistent cough
        * %vomiting @coughing spaasm.
        * %cyanosis @coughing spasm == apnoea
        * highly contagious == other members of family infected
        * milder cough lasting for months after the paroxysmal phase
        * @babies == may not cough that much but rather apnoeas/ cyanosis. 
        * @adult == usu no whoop sound. 
    + E
        * severe coughing @in middle of spasm, but otherwise generally no signs.
        * %cyanosis @apnoea due to coughing
        * usu no fever.
        * high pitched whooping sound may be heard after coughing fit
    + I
        * nasopharyngeal swab for PCR. usu negative after 21 days or 5-7 days after starting abx
        * IgA positive for BPertussis but rarely done
- management
    + Abx
        * consider @
            -  diagnosed in catarrhal other early paroxysmal phase to reduce severity.
            -  already admitted/ <4 months of age.
            -  complciations present (eg pneumonia, cyanosis/ apnoea)
            -  coughing for leess than 14 days to reduce spread
        * usu with macrolide (Azithromycin), otherwise Bactrim  
    + hospital admission 
        * esp @<4 months/ presence of complications == admit @high risk of deteiroriation.
        * referral to PICU @++WCC > 30 x 10^3
    + infection control
        * exclude school or contact with other children for 21 days of coughing or 5 days of treatment.
    + notificiation
        * notify all cases suspected or confirmed to CDS Victoria
    + still recieve all DTPa vaccinations
    + supportive care @complications
        * apnoea (mech vent)
        * seizure treatment
        * ECMO / exchange trasnfusion
- prophylaxis for infants
    + aim to stop spread to <6 months.
    + @IUTD and full pertussis done with 3 doses completed at 8 months == do not need
    + only @history of close contact
    + same antibiotics as above

--------------------------
# Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis)
    URT inflammation @virus, ++%parainfluenza virus, most common @6 months - 6 years
    usu lasts for 1 days but can last 1 week
    usu mild illness == can be managed as outpatient
    other causes include: Influenza A/B, RSV, measles, Diphteria (Coryebacterium diphteriae)
    affects 15% of children at some point. 

- clinical
    + H
        * stridor (severity of stridor not a good indicator of severity)
        * hoarseness
        * 'barking' cough
        * %worse at night
        * increased WOB @obstruction
        * %fever but no features of systemic toxicity.
        * %widespread wheeze associated
    + E (very short quick examination @minimal handling)
        * behaviour (agitated, drowsy)
        * tachypnnoea/ bradypnoea
        * WOB, with subcostal retractions == more severe
        * SaO2 (@desaturation very severe which indicates life threatening croup)
        * throat examination not needed
    + I
        * no investigations needed @may cause distress and worsen symptoms
            - a neck xray will likely show 'steeple sign', narrowing oft the upper trachea.
- differntials
    + inhaled FB
    + epiglottitis
    + bacterial tracheitis 
- medical
    + rf for seevere Croup
        * pre-existing narrowing of upper airwways, prev severe croup, <6 months old. very unusual <3 months so other diagnoses must be entertained.
- prevention
    + influenza and Diptheria vaccination
- managmenet
    + treatment is supportive
    + minimal handling w/ limited examination
    + keep children with carer
    + allow child to adopt own posture
    + medications
        * mild-mooderate: dexamethasone 0.15mg/kg, Prednisolone 1mg/kg
        * severe: nebulised adrenaline and steroids  
    + refer immediately @severe upper airway obstruction and failure to respond to treatment == ICU/ anaesthetics
    + defer IV access
    + DC stridor free at rest AND has had 4 hours of neb adrenaline OR 30 minutes after steroid administration

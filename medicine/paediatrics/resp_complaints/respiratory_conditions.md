###### Common respiratory conditions in children
    @young == get 6-12 infx per yeaer. usu cough <3 weeks, @longer == must rule out other causes.
    asthma usu not present with cough
    URTI is the most common cause, self limtiing and does not need treatment.

# Approach to wheezing child
    common pres @young, 20% infants wheeze, 40% children under 6 have at least 1 wheezing episode. 

# Approach to Persistent Cough
    Whooping Cough (time course and presence of cough fits)
    Viral URTI/ Common Cold (absence of concerning/ onset) -- <3 weeks cough

        * avoid exposure to cigarette smoke
        * arrange follow up with LMO in 2-3 weeks
    + @unwell chiuld with abnormal examination  
        * further investigations
        * rule out whooping cough, asthma, foreign body inhalation, sinusitis, CXR @no other obvious cause + followup with a paediatrician.

# Bronchiolitis

    + supportive treatment
        * mild (usu discharge, monitor in ED with 2 measurements, ensure small freq feeds, eeducate and reassure)
        * moderate (usu admit, however may be DC @period of observation. 1-2 hourly obs, NG hydration @not feeding adequately, administer O2 to maintain sats above 90% NPO2, HFNC @failed NPO2)
        * severe (admit. %PICU @tert referral. continous oximetry + nursing obs. NG hydrate @not feeding. HFNC/ CPAP to maintain 90% sats.)

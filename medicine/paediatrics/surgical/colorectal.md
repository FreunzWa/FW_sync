        * formation of myenteric plexus and submucosal plexus during development, failure to migrate == incomplete nerve supply == parts of teh affected segment cnanot relax == obstrcution
    + complications
        * sepsis
        * perforation
        * toxic megacolon
        * Hirschsprung associated enterocolitis (HAEC)

# Neonatal surgical emergencies
[Wharton's jelly; gelatinous substance within umbilical cord also @vitresous humor in eyeball. its function is to protect mechanically and thermal the umbilical cord vesselss. express stem cell lineage.  ]

# Abdominal wall defects
- exomphalos / omphalocele
    + medical
        * weakness @midline abdominal wall @umbilical site.
        * covered with 3 layers; Amnion, Wharton's jelly, pertinoeum. the cord/ umbilical vessels insert at the apex of the herniated contents
        * 80% of ompaloceles contain at leasat part of the liver. larger liver containing usu associated with euploidy, whereas small ones associated with aneuploidy of fetus.
        * either liver containing or not.
        * risk of loss of heat and fluid @the exposed sac.
        * embryology:
            - @week 6 of development, abdo cavity temporarily too small to accommodate contents == protrusion of midgut into residual extraembroynic coelom at the base o fthe umbilical cord. "physiological midgut herniation". must have reverted by 12th week otherwise no longer physiological. liver is never pysiological
            - @fialure of left and right lateral folds to close normally == large defect
        * rf
            - @extremes of maternal age
    + usu diagnosed prenatally in morpholgy scan, >90% diagnosed prentaally. can diagnose @liver presence. 80 
- gastroschisis
    + full thickness paraumbilical abdo wall defect == bowel outside %with other organs. 
    + medical
        * prognosis usu very good.
        * complications
            - infection, mesenteric blood supply disturbed == ischaemia
            - risk of heat and water loss from the bowel
            - FGR/ FTT
    + treatment
        * cover the bowel with glad wrap
        * gastrointestinal decompression with NGT and IV fluid hydration
        * surgical closure

# SCT
- any lump over sacrum should be assumed to be SCT until proven otherwise. ==immediate referral @highly malingnat.


# Major Trauma 
    refer to tert @needed, expose to ensure nno injuriese missed.
- head trauma most common major trauma
    + IV fluid resus to perfuse brain. 
    + blood transfusion O neg (then crossmatched)
    + conntinuous monitoring
    + family educated ongoing, allowed to witness resus.
    + adequate analgesia important @managment
    + neck immobilisation in cervical collar until spinal column injuries ruled out.
- investigations
    + cross match needed for all major trauma
    + ABG to assist ventilation assessment (need normal PCO2)
    + electrolyes and coags
    + CXR to be performed @all major trauma. PXR @risk, CT @indicated.

# Aspirated foreign body (FBA)
    esp @<2 years of age. still mortality assoc but less @modern bronchoscopy techniques.
- medical 
    + mx
        * @childdren walking and exploringn, but cannot chew food adequately. also @distractions while eating and improper foods
        * younger children have narrow airway == prone to obstruction
        * toy balloons/ inflated gloves etc have highest rate of mortality. round objects more dangerouus @more likely complete obstruction
        * medication aspiration esp K+ or Fe can cause long term infllammatiuo annd setenonsis of airwawys.
        * ++aspirated body lodges in bronchi (60% RMB). tracheal and llaryngeal are less common but more dangerous
    + complications 
        * asyphxiation
        * secondary infection/ inflammation of the airways
        * atelectasis
- clinical
    + usu present with partial airway obstruction ++with cough. %haemoptysis, cyanosis.
    + stridor
    + wheeze
    + decreased air entry
    + H
        * choking: episode of choking w/ sudden onset of cough/ dyspnoea/ cyanosis @previous haelthy child. lasts few seconds-minutes. acute episode usu self limited and may be followed @asymptomatic period @descent of the FB
    + E
        * quick focused examination
    + I
        * CXR
- management
    + First aid (back slaps timed with coughing)
    + give oxygen and refer to ENT surgeon
    + @complete obstruction (unable to speak or cough!)
        * surgical open airway w/ laryngoscope and remove with Magill foreceps. 
        * @cannot see == turn child prone and 5 thrusts interscapular, turn child supine and 5 CPR thrusts == check if has appeared. 
        * @not appeared, perform cricothyrotom/ tracheostomy
        * @resp failure due to foreign body lodged in lower trachea == attempt ventilation via ET and organise rigid bronchoscopic removal

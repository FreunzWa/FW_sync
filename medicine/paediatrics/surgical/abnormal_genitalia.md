###### Abnormal genitalia




# Urethral
- duplication of urethra
    + 2 urethral openings. usu one blind ending, but %extends all the way to bladder
- meatal ulceration
    + rf
        * @circumcision
    + prevent @protective ointment/ vaseline to prevent further irritation
    + medical
        * complications: 
            - %==meatal stenosis == urinary obstruction
- Hypospadias
    + congenital abnormality with urethral opening underside of penis
- posterior urethral valve
    + ==dilated posterior urethra == %incontinence.

# Ambiguous genitalia

# Penile anomalies
- chordee
    + deficiency of ventral tissues on penis and around the urethra == significant bend in shaft worse @erection (cannot get erect without significant pain)
    + surge
- epispadias
    + rare closure of anterior abdominal wall == no shaft of penis
    + ==severe incontinence
    + assoc with ventral hood of foreskin
    + on the epispadias-extrophy spectrum
    + bladder extrophy (failure of ant abdo wall closure == bladder external)

# Foreskin
- phimosis
    + tight foreskin == cannot retract
    + %poorly performed circumcision with too short foreskin == burial of penis/ glans and obstruction of urinary flow.
    + %==ballooning of foreskinduring urinartion
    + medical
        * causes
            - trauma (eg circumcision or foreskin pulled back forcibly too early)
            - infection (E.coli) during phase of spearation.
        * complications
            - urinary obstruction (distorted penis)
    + rx
        * @urinary obstruction == requires emergency circumcision. 
- paraphimosis
    + foreskin compresses shaft after retraction == congestion of glans
    + usu occurs just after foreskin spearated from glans == usu in toddlers/ early primary years
    + glans compressed until can be pushed back inside.
- dorsal hood of foreskin
    + failure of the foreskin to form on the ventral surface
- ventral hood of foreskin

# Acute penis
- Balanitis
    + @infection of space between glans and foreskin, proliferation @reatined urine == superficial ulceration and pain.
    + rx
        * topical antibiotics +/- systemic
- ulcerated glans penis
    + rf
        * @circumcision == trauma to glandular epithelium of glans == secondary infection @E coli from urine
- hemorrhagic penis
    + rf
        * bleeding @circumcision

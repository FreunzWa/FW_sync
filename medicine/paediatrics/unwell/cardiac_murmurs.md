###### Cardiac murmur assessment
    cardiac assessment 
    innocent murmurs
    congenital cardiiac disease
        cynaotic lesions
            4 Ts
        obstructive lesions
            coarctation of teh aorta
            AS
            PS
        lesions with left to right shunt
            VSD, ASD, PDA

# Cardiac assessment
- H
- E
    + growth, liver size
    + praecordial: active haeve, thrill, heart sounds, physiological S2
        * heart sounds: S1/ S2.
            - physiological splittiing due to inspiration == ++venous return == decreased pressure differential between RH and pulmoanary systrem == delayed closure of the pulmonary valve and later S2. 
        * heart sounds, never assume correct position! always describe relative to sternal border/ apex
    + femoral pulses (important), @coarctation 
- I
    + saturations
    + ECG
    + echocardiography
        * definitve for most congenital lesions. good definition @thin chest wall. 
    + HRCT
    + cardiac catheterisation
    + MRI heart (emerging modality)

# Cardiac murmurs
- innocent murmurs
    + ~50% children have innocent murmur detected (physiological turbulence around anatomical variants)
    + not assoc with pathology, usu early/ ejection systolic.
    + if it is purely diastolic it is not innocent!
    + 4 types
        * Still's vibratory murmur
            - most cmmon, heard bewteen 2-7. low to medium pitched musical. cresecendo. maximal LLSE. 
            - ddx: small VSD and subaortic stenosis
        * Pulmonaryh flow murmur
            - 2nd most common. adolescents. 
            - ejection to mid systolic peak
            - medium to high pitch
            - require TTE to exclude pulmonary stenosis and ASD as they cannot be distinguished clinically
        * suprclavicular bruit
        * Branch pulmonary stenosis (pulmonary ejection murmur)
            - infants <6months, @small size of PA bifurication. 
            - radiate to axilla and back
        * venous hums
            - low pitch continuous 
            - heard @low anterior neck, more often on the right and in the infraclavicular area
            - louder when erect. (only innocent murmur where this is the case). 
            - SVC right atrial junction 
            - less lou @JV compression or neck turning
            - ddx PDA
    + differentiation
        * increase volume with inspiration
        * usu louder @supine (apart from venous hum) and disappears when erect

# Managmenet
- refer to cardiology @
    + <1 year has a murmur
    + loud grade 3 murmur
    + obvious splitting of S2 (or fixed splitting)
    + absent respiratory variation
    + diastolic or continuous murmurs.

###### DKA
    remember to correct serum Sodium for a high glucose
    cerebral edema must be prevented, as the main life threatening complication of DKA
    may present at any age 
    mean age of presentation around 7-8 years, however increased risk of presentation <2 yrs and >10 yrs
    @<2yrs old == more likely severe DKA-

    0–4, 5–9, and 10–14 years, DKA was present in 16.5, 14.8, and 26.4%

# Approach
- medical
    + triggers      
        * @insufficient insulin @known T1DM or first presentation of T1DM
        * illness, where there are increased insul reqauirement
    + complications (of DKA and treatment)
        * cerebral edema (due to high glucsose == shift from ICF to ECF)
        * hypoglycaemia
        * hyper/ hypokalaemia
        * aspiration (if neuroglogically obtunded0)
        * hypo/hypernatremia
        * total body potassium is depleted (regardless of serum K+ level)
- diagnosis
    + criteria
        * glucose >11
        * venous pH < 7.3, or Bicarb < 15
        * presence of ketonaemia or Ketonuria
- HEI
    + H
        * polydipsia/ polyuria
        * weight loss
        * 
    + I
        * serum glucose >11? 
        * UEC (potassium and sodium)
        * VBG (bicarb and pH)
        * FBE (haematocrit elevated in dehydration, WCC %elevated @systemic stress response)
        * serum ketones (normal <0.6 mol/L)
        * %work out underlying cause (eg septic workup)
        * diagnostic workup for first presentation of T1DM: insulin Abs, GAD Abs, ZnT8 abs, celiac screen.  
        * urine: dipstick for ketones and glucose, culture @suspicious for UTI
        * ECG? if potassium results delayed

# Managemenet
- people
    + referrral to tert care @necessary, endocrinologist, PICU?
- assessment
    + hydration status
        * weigh child, on history, on examination (TT, MM, CRT, pale)
        * degree of hydration
            - <4 % = no clinical signs
            - 4-7% = -=TT, MM, poor CRT
            - >7% = shock, hypotension and tachycardiaz
        * severity judged @degree of acidaemia
    + investigations
        * hourly BGLs, bedside ketone testing
        * 2 hourly and then 2-4 hourly VBG, UEC, Ca, Mg, Phosphate
        * key is to monitor Na, K and glucose and manage approriately.s
- steps
    + fluid replacement
        * but beware @++fluid replacmenet == ++risk of CE
- medication
    + dehydration
        * fluid replacement with NS, continue to adjust fluids @electrolytes
            - usually classify as mild-moderate dehydrated. 
    + BGL
        * insulin infusion
        * once BGL <15 mmol, use NS + 5% glucose and K+
        * aim to keep BGL 5-10
        * if the BGL is falling rapidly (>5 mmol/ hr), then increase the glucose content to 10%s
        * insulin infusion rate only decreased @BGL continues to fall despite glucose conc of 10%s
    + K+
        * K+ is depleted, but serum potassium may be anything. 
        * @insulin treatment == shift of K+ to intracellular space == hypokalaemia == requires replacement. KCl commenced at 40mmol/ L to maintain K+
        * K+ should be assayed within 1 hour and 2-4 hrly thereafter.
    + Sodium 
        * @hyperglycaemia == dilutional effect on sodium levels. 
    + Phosphate
        * if levels are dropping == change KCl to KPO4 to replace both phosphate and K at the same time.
    + 
    + antibiotics if febrile on presentation



# Cerebral edema in DKA
    
- rf
    + @first presentation of DKA
    + long history of poor control
    + age <5 yrs
- clinical
    + presentation
        * early: headache, irritability, lethargy, vomiting
        * later: depressed consiousness, incontinence, thermal instability
        * very late: bradycardia, increased BP, respiratory impairment
- rx
    + nurse head up (reduces blood flow and fluid to brain)
    + reduce fluid infusion rate by 1/3
    + mannitol  given immediately! given over 20 minutes, and repeat @no improvement within 30-60 minutes


# Hypoglycamiea due to treatment of DKA
- @hypoglycaemia (or glucose falling too rapidly) == incrdase the glucose given to 10% given with the NS.
- if the hypoglycaemia continues despite 10% glucose for 2 hours then decrease ins ifusion. 
- can use oral treatment with juice/ jellybeans to increase glucose.

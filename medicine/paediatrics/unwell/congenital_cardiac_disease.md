###### Congenital cardiac disease
[secundum; means second opening]
# Causes
    VSD 25-30%
    ASD 7%
    PDA 7%
    Coarctation of the aorta 7%
    TOF 7%
    Pulmonary valve stenosis 7%
    Aortic valve stenosis 7%
    Other... 

# Cardiac embryology
- single atrium becomes separated by the septum primum, precursor to the interatrial septum. the septum primum fuses with the embryo septum secundum == closure of FO, unless incomplete fusion

# Fetal cardiac circuit
- ductus arteriosus (ductus Botalli) connects the pulmonary trunk to teh proximal descending aorta, allows the RV to bypass the fluid filled non functioning lungs. @closure == ligamentum arteriosum
- UV carries o2 blood from placenta to fetus. travels along teh liver as the ductus venosus to join with the IVC supplying o2 blood to the rest of the haeart.
- UAs carry deoxygenated blood to the placenta to be reoxygenated.

# Pulmonary high flow states
- VSD (35% of CHD)  
    + medical
        * @small == usu close on own uisu no symptoms. murmur.
        * @large == poor growth/ tachypnoea, -= oral intake, %pulmonary hypertension
    + ix
        * TTE for location, number and size of VSDs, RVP and LV dilatation
    + rx
        * diuretics 
        * surgical (usu open but catheterisation is emerging + combined)
- ASDs - "Foramen Secundum" (10% of CHD) 
    + physiological closure of FO @birth @pulmonary pressure
    + usu no sx until 3-4th decade, can cause PTH, heart failure and arrhytmias. 
    + usu just presetn with ejection systolic murmur, %low growth.
    + fixed OR obvious splitting of S2 (as RV is always volume loaded. in inspiration == RV filling but @expiration LV pressure is higher == goes to RV anyway)
    + 95% have rsR'
    + CXR: prominent right atrium and icnreased pulmonary vascularity.
    + rx
        * 80% of small defects will close spontaneously.
        * surgical close @4-5 yrs. very safe surgery.
        * direct closure. 
        * device closure is emerging (catheterisation), device plugging the defect (only for suitable defect shapes)
- PDA (7% of CHD)
    + usu close @first day of life (first 15 hrs usu). 
    + spont closure rare after 2 weeks. (but may close still up until 3 months)
    + continuous murmur
    + @premature == prolonged ventilation requirement
    + pw
        * @small: slow growth, FTT in teh first year of life and continuous murmur
        * @large: present @4 weeks with v poor growth and tachypnoea. usu only systolic murmur.
    + ix
        * TTE
    + rx
        * indomethacin to close PDA
        * direct thoracotomy surgery @small sympatomatic infant
        * catheter @large
- AVSD ("Canal defect")
    + strong association with T21
    + large defect between ASD and VSD septtums == 1 valve instead of normal 2 AV valves by suturing the middle, creation of an atrial and a ventricular patch
    + early surgical repaire required in most cases @4-6 months old. 

# Obstructive lesions
    coarctation
    subaortic stenosis
- interrupted aortic arch
    + interruption between the asccendinng and descending aorta. however blood still gets to body @DA patent from the RV/ pulmoanry trunk. @closure of DA after birth == no blood flow to body == death if untreated.
- coarctation of the aorta
    + narrowing of aorta  == decreased pulses in femoral/ pop/ post tibial
    + presents 10 days after PDA closure, life threatening with severe downstream ischaemia. gut
    + 50% have associated VSD, mitral valve abns, AS
    + rx    
        * prostin E2 to reopen the DA
        * end to end anastomosis, patch repair
        * catheter +/- stent if recoarctation
    + ix
        * rib notching on CXR
- subaortic stenosis
    + membrane obstructing the valve proximal to valve == LVH
    + %caused @HOCM/ idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis

# Valvular lesions
    absent pulmonary valve syndrome
    aortic/ pulmonary stenosis
    subaortic stenosis
- absent pulmonary valve syndrome
    + VSD with narrowing at pulmonary valve, but PV is severely incompetent @vestigial leaflets
    + PAs are enlarged @high pressure == compression of bronchi

- aortic stenosis
- pulmonary stenosis

# Cyanotic cardiac disease
    Diseases
        TOF
        TGA (ccTGA)
        Tricuspid atresia
        Truncus arteriosus
    Desaturation, require <50 g/L haemoglobin to be clinically apparent. 
    %@CyCD present pink
- Tetralogy of Fallot
    + most common CyCD
    + severity dependent on degree of PS
    + lesions:
        * RV outflow tract obstruction (supra/sub valvular pulmonary stenosis), VSD, overriding aorta, RVH
    + no intervention needed until 6 months
    + assoc with various ChrAbns
    + rx
        * closure of VSD
        * resect right ventricular outflow obstruction
    + complications
        * pulmonary regugrgiation, A/V arrhytmias, right ventircular dilatation and dysfunction
- Transposition of the great arteries
    + most common cause of cyanosis, developes over first day
    + 70% are males
    + lethal condition without treatment
    + have an ASD (PFO) == ++pulmonary blood flow
    + surgery performed in first 2 weeks, called ann arterial switchoperation
    + congenitally corrected:
        * the atria are connected to the wrong ventricles. in standard TGA the RV is connected to Aorta. same in ccTGA but RA feeds into LV first before RV so not as bad
        * not cyanotic @the blood from lungs passes to aorta. may not require surgery. usu associated with VSD and other abnormalities. 
- tricuspid atreisa
    + no tricuspid valve + ASD, and VSD to allow blood to flow from LV to RV
    + hypoplastic ventricle
    + require a shunt operation during infancy.  'fontan procedure'

# Left to right shunt cardiac diseases
- heightened pulmonary blood flow @left to right shunt == more volume int eh right side of teh heart. 
- clinical
    + ==tachypnoea, recession, failure to thrive
- types
    + VSD
        * most common, 30% of CHD. variable haeomdynamic effect basaed on size. 
        * SMall VSD
            - pansystoilic LLSE, difficult to hear early @++PVR @birth. 
            - loud murmur @small size of VSD (eq of continuity == more turbulence)
            - murmur emerges once teh PVR falls
            - no haeomdynamic effects
        * Large VSD
            - symptoms emerge as teh PVR falls over 1-3 weeks
            - usu require surge unless reducee spont in size
            - eisenmenger complex: pulmonary hypertension 2nd to VSD (eventually causinig right to left shunt). assoc with T21
        * VSD location
            - perimembranouss
            - muscular (high chance of spont closure, but difficult to close surge)
            - doubly committed
                + ++risk of AV regugitation
        * VSD investigation
            - TTE
                + numebr and locatiton
                + estimateion of pressure gradient and assess RV function and pressure
    + AVSD

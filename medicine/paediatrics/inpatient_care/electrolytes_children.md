###### Electrolytes


# Monitoring electrolytes
    esp @IV fluids
- sodium
    + @rapid rise in sodium == osmotic demyelination
        * should not increase >8 mmol/ L / day
    + @rapid decrease == cerebral edema
        * should not fall >12 mmol/ L/ day


# Hypernatremia
    mild Hypernatremia is relativelyt common
    treatment is complex and potentailyl dangerous
- common
    + water loss in excess of sodium losses
        * diarrhoea
        * severe burns
    + inadequate intake
        * eg neonatal not enough BF
        * inability to swallow water
- rarer causes
    + D insipidus (eg ADH insufficient)
    + impaired thirst drive (hypothalamic lesion)
    + osmotic diuresis
    + iatrogenic gain of sodium
- clinical
    + seizures, reduced GCS, hyperreflexia
    + ataxia/ remor
    + irritable/ lethargic
- ix
    + UEC
    + consider VBG
    + consider urine sodium and osmolality for modereate-severe hypernatremia
- treat
    + usu with rehydration, NGT is preferred. Gastrolyte can be used @has a low sodium concentration'
        * @NGT required == can use NS + gluc OR plasmalyte + 5% Gluc
    + monitor sodium every few hours. do not allow to fall >0.5 mmol/ L / hr (12 total for a day)

# Hyponatremia
    ranges do not vary with age: 
    130-135: mild
    120-129: moderate
    <120   : severe
    acute @<48 hours
    chronic @>4 hours
    most common electrolyte abn @children

- medical
    + etiology
        * iatrogenic
            - haemodilution @fluid esp @hypotonic fluid
            - surgery == ADH release
        * fever/ hypovolaemia/ head injury/ CNS infections/ respiratory disorders == ADH release
    + either hypotonic hyonatremia or hyponatremia without hypotonicity
        * hypotonic hyponatremia 
            - @GI losses == appropriate ADH release in excesso fserum solutes 
            - @respiratory conditions/ CNS infections/ endocrine disorders/ surgeyr/ various drugs == ADH release
            - primary polyipsia == normovolaemia but hyponatremia
            - hypervolaemia @renal failure (cannot excrete free water)
        * hyponatremia without hypotonicity
            - eg @increased tonicity due to urea/ hyperglycaemia, %exogenous solutes eg mannitol/ sorbitol
                + @hyperglycaemia == ++tonicitiy == water from 3rd space == sodium dilution
                + azotemia @renal fialure == %BUN increase. however urea is freely able to cross cell membranes therefore does not act as an osmole
- clinical
    + presentation
    + investigations
        * serum tonicity: 2xNa + glucose mmol/L
- management
    + maintenance fluids only 1/2 of 2/3 of normal calculated amount from 421 rule.
    + if seizures/ encephalopathy == ICU contacted. 
        * IV 3% hypertonic salline 3-5 ml/ kg
        * remeseasure Na+ in teh first 3-4 hrs to ensure not increasing by >2 mmol/ L/ hr 
    + else
        * @dehydrated and Na+ < 130
            - Give IV isotonic saline + 5% dextrose at full maintenance rates
            - measure serum sodium 4-6 hrly until Na > 125
        * @dehydrated and Na+ 130-134
            - consider ORS, enteral rehydration. however ORS is hypotnoic. @fails to correct == commence IV saline + 5% dextrose
        * @>=euvolaemic
            - restrict total fluid intake 1/2-2/3 of maintenacne, pref enteral feedings otherwise IV saline + 5% dextrose
        * continue monitoring for Na levels, do not allow to rise > 8 mmol/ L in 24 hrs

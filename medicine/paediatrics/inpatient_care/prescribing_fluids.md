###### Prescribing fluids
    always prefer to use enteral fluids @better tolerated and easier to regulate electrolytes
    @IV fluids == musut be monitored
    fluids associated with highest number of adverse outcomes
    always check compatilibty with any oither drugs co-administered
    children esp suspcetible to abnormaltities of fluid balance @much higher turnover of TBW than in adults.


###### Giving fluids
    fluids are given for 3 considerations as a total:

    1. baseline maintenance fluids + 2. ongoing losses + 3. defecits (dehydration)

# Maintenance fluid
 - 4,2,1 rule for calculating maintenance fluids ml/ kg/ hr
 - use NS with 5% glucose +/- 20 mmol/ L KCl for maintenance hydration
 - 2/3 of this value should be used any UNWELL child. @ in serious conditions like meningitis/ other CNS infections or respitoray infections eg. pnaeumoanoi/ bronchiolitis. @ADH secretion  == may fluid restrict further. consult senior
 - full maintenace used @relatively well eg well child fasting for theatre

# Replacing defecit fluids (rehydration therapy)
- assess the degree of dehydration:
    + weight changes (compare recent weight measurement over last 2 weeks)
    + clinical
        * mild <%4
        * moderate: 4-7%, poor CRT (
        >2seconds), -=TT, increased RR
    + severe >7% @signs of shock, deep acidotic breathing, very delayed CRT >3 secs, mottled skin
- rapid rehydration
    + 10 mk/hr for 4 hours of (plasmalyte OR NS )+ dextrose
- Defecit calculation
    + is given in mls, calculated with the %dehydration (determine on weight or clinical signs) eg 5% of a 10kg child has a defecit of 500 ml
- considerations
    + must monitor @hypernatremic (aim to rehydrate over 48 hours, and Na+ should not fall by >1mmol/ L/hour) -- risk of cerebral edema
- give boluses of 10-20 ml/ kg of NS in hypovolaemic patient.

# Fluid resusciation
- fluid bolus of 20 mk of NS can be given @shocked

# Replacing ongoing losses
- estimate losses over the last 4 hours and replace over the next four hours (eg from drains, ileostomy, profuse diarrhoea). 
- it cna be difficult to quantify vomiting/ diarrhoea losses == often better simply to reassess clinically, refer to body weights and then adjust accordingly.
- can use normal saline to replace these losses unless ++protein losses == may use 5% albumin

- @fasting == @low glucose stores == requires ongoing dextrose 5% to avoid hypoglycaemia

----------------------------------------------------

# Choice of Fluids
- NGT options
    + breast milk (for use with NGT) if the mother can express
    + ORS - gastrolyte/ hydralyte/ pedialyte (if mother cannot express)
    + normal saline may be used @require tailored rehydration plan (eg @bronchiolitis or hypernatremia)
- IV options
    + 0.9% Normal saline + 5% Dextrose
    + Plasmalyte + 5% Dextrose
    + 10 mmol K+ will often be combined with fluid for maintenance of K levels

# Rarer fluid choices
- 10% dextrose may be used in ICU for infants <12 months, often usede with 0.45% saline. %used @metabolic disorders



# Route
    note that vomiting is not a CI for NGT - need to try slow and ondansetron
- vomiting
    + eg @gastroenteritis still prefer NGTR @better tolerated. usu stop vomiting after NGT insertion. 
    + @still vomiting, consider ondansetron and slow NG fluid temporarily.
- options
    + slower NGT hydration
        * preferred @<6 months
        * comorbid disease
        * significant abdo pain
    + rehydration
        * preferred NGTR (nasogastric rehydration) preferred @moderate dehydration (even with vomiting). 
    + rapid rehydration
        * rate of 25 ml/ kg/ hr for 4 hours
        * suitable for majority of patients with gastro and moderate dehydration
        * avoi infants <6 months
- indications
    + NGT indications
        * <3 years old
        * no need for an IV
        * CRT < 3 seconds
    + IV indications    
        * failed NGT
        * severe dehydration (shock)
        * GIT conditions (short gut/ previous GIT surgery)
        * already have IV in situ
        * seriously unwell


# Clinical assessment
- determining degree of fluid defecit
- weight
    + absolute measure of degree of fluid defecit with before and after weights
- clinical examination (clinical signs only given approximation)
    + tissue turgor, tachycardia, central capillary refill, mucous membranes, saturations, resp effort, history of vomiting/ diarrhoea, weights (preferably on teh same set of scales)
- can then predict severity of fluid loss:
    + mild <4%
    + moderate ~4-6%
        * delayed CRT >2 secs
        * mild decreased TT
        * increased RR
    + severe (>7%)
        * very delayed CRT >3 secs, mottled skin
        * shock vital signs, acidotic breathing (kussmaul)
        * decreased TT
- after mild/ moderate/severe is decided fluid provision will be determined

# Delivery of fluid
- nasogastric
    + awlways trial @mild-moderate illness in children 
    + better @decrease risk of infection, electrolyte imbalances
- IV
    + @unwell/ contraindication for NGT (or failed NGT)
    + relative cautions for NGT
        * unilateral/ bil choanal atresia (obligate nose breathe)





# Monitoring resopnse to fluids
- Fluid balance chart: (input/ output charts) and regular weights (6 hourly), regular electrolytes taken esp @existing derangements
- elecctryolyte measurements taken before IV started and 24 hours after starting
    + sodium:   
        * concerned about osmotic demyelination @excessive increase. cutoff 8 mmol/ L increase of serum Na per day. == slow provision of fluid delivry.
        * 
- Bloods

# Replacement fluid therapy
- max rate of replacement is 25 ml/ kg per hour

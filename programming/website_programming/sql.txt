====== sql ======

server side language used for storing/ manipualting/ retrieving data in databases. sql is standard, but there are different versions, but all support the major commands
"structured query language"

to use sql in web site, need an RDBMS database program (eg SQL server, MySQL, MS Access)
a server side scripting language (PHP)
 html/ css to style and give structure to the page

=== basic theory ===
every table broken up into smaller entities called fields. a field is a column in a table which maintains specific infromation about every "record" in the table. records are rows, each an individual entry in the table.

=== syntax ===
sql keywords are not case sensitive
semicolon at end ofc statements.

=== most important SQL commands ===
SELECT
UPDATE
DELETE
INSERT INTO
CREATE DATABASE
ALTER DATABASE
CREATE TABLE
ALTER TABLE
DROP TABLE
CREATE INDEX
DROP INDEX 

=== SELECT statement ===
select is used to select data from database... thereturned dat is stored in a result table, called hte result-set
SELECT <list of field names to select data from> FROM <table_name>;
the '*' character may be used to select all data from a givne table

SELECT DISTINCT statment used to return only different values, avoiding duplicates.
eg SELECT DISTINCT <fields> FROM <table name>;

=== WHERE ===
where clause is used to filter records, with a where clause will only extract records that fulfill a specified condition. used in select and other commands. 
SELECT <field names> FROM <table name> WHERE <>condition:
eg.
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';
various comparison operators can be used with WHERE:
= 			Equal
<> 			Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=
> 			Greater than
< 			Less than
>=		 	Greater than or equal
<= 			Less than or equal
BETWEEN 	Between a certain range
LIKE 		Search for a pattern
IN 			To specify multiple possible values for a column

can also combine multiple clauses with boolean operators (AND, NOT, OR)
syntax: WHERE  condition1 AND condition2 AND NOT condition3

# Small talk phase
    decision should be made at start of small take phase whether to take it into deeper waters 'meaningful phase'. 
    small talk should be characterised by being jovial and trivial. should be playful, at times challenging. the style of small talk should depend on whether there is a desired transition.
    most of conversation does inevitably take place in the small talk phase.
    the importance of the small talk phase cannot be overstated.
    categories:
    the 'hook': the hook is cast to attempt to transition to meaningful phase.
- basic phase
    + basic is often awkward as it is inherently boring. 
    + the goal is to incorporate wit phase with basic phase, serving both purposes.
- wit phase
    + playful humor, exaggerative, demonstrative, dont take self seriously
- hook 'element'
    + the hook is cast to progress to the meaningful phase, acts as an invitation. 
    + if the other party does not want to progress the hook can be rejected, in which case either small talk phase proceeds, or conv gradually closes.

# Meaningful phase
    when talking about things that matter, especially when opinions are involved.
    conversations here are richer and stimulating.
    not necessarily serious here, but there is less joking
    the meaningful phase must succeed small talk phase, even if the small talk phase is very small. 
    the meaningful phase usu only to be used when parties are stationary or will be in company for long time predicted.
    may interchange with small talk phase

Assessment:
- graded: 2x mini CEXs (one in aged care, one in palliative care)
- check: family meeting attendance
- check: case report of a patient

Goals:
- present patients and get involved 
- go to all clinic placements, and learn as much as possible
- review the syllabus for this term and construct a structure for approaching each clinic.

###### Day 1
- Chronic wounds tutorial
    + know all of the different types of common chronic wounds + other rarer ones (like PG, buruli, malingancy as a cause of chronic ulcers)
    + be able to describe the wounds well, and standard management for each wound type in terms of dressing, when surge would be indicated, when use Abx
    + review the images presented for each wound type and revise notes

- Chronic pain tutorial
    + which parts of the pain transduction pathway you are targeting when using  a given medication
    + most common opioids
    + side effects of opioids
    + understand how modulation plays a role in the perception of pain, how with trauma the emotional context actually exacerbates the pain
    + how pain is managed in eg. OA, IBS, chronic neuropathic pain
    + understand how pain is different in older people - why they present later with pain but have a lower pain threshold, and how this prolongs recovery from pain.

- Comprehensive Geriatric assessment tutorial
    + full of evaluation of the aged patient in making treatment decisions
    + co-morbidities should be treated/ optimised as co-morbidities exacerbate any otherwise physiological decline in cognition.

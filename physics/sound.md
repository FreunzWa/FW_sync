###### Sound
[fudamental frequency; defined as the lowest resonstant frequency of a vibrating obvject. most vibratin g objects have more than one resonsant frequency]
[transverse standing wave; wave affecting string. must return to zero at each en  dof teh string in transverse standing wave == the number of half avelngths must be an integer. quantised number of half wavelengths. nodes - points at zero amplitude, antinodes are points with maximum amplitude. string stationary @nodes. more nodes == more energy]
[harmonic; an integer multiple of teh fundamental frequency ]



# Sound intensity
- intensity is measure of amount of energy trasnported by a wave per time through a plane of unit area perpendicular to waves propagation direction
- total energy = sum of kminetic and potential energies (potential energy of the local vibration of small gas elements), similar for spring. 
- energy density given through arbitrary volume
- energy density proportional to the amplitude squared. - for sound this is the square of the maximum pressure variation
- most commonly used uinit system is log scale @huge variation in intensities (10^7 magnitude orders between whisper ad jet engine).
- pressure variation in a sound wave defined as sound pressure level (SPL - unit decibels), the log of the presssure variation over the faintest detectable sound by the human ear. negative decibel levels are not detecetable. however intensity is not directly related to the 'loudness of hte sound', because being able to hear a sound also depends on teh frequency
- db calculated from IL equation:
    + IL = 10*log(10){I/I0}


# Sound intensity loss
- @imperfections in medium eg gas pocket vibrations not perfeectly harmonic == incompletely adiabiatic process occurs == heating of the air @sound == eenergy loss and sound intensity dissapation
- follows inverse square law to satisfy convservation of energy
    + I = 1/(r^2)

# Sound absorption
- Beer's Law
    + states that hte loss of intensity per unit of medium (dI/dx) is proportional to the absolute intensity of the sound wave -- provides the gradient of intensity reduction of sound.
    + the absorption coefficient depends on the medium (materials parameter) and the frequency of the sound. -- can use frequency independent attenutation coefficient (a) as a materials constant.

# Doppler effect

# Snell's law
- law of refraction; goverened @ the acoustic impedance of the 2 adjacemnt media. acoustic impedance is the product of density and speed of sound in a given material.

# Ultrasound image
- US first used clinically 1956
- US transducer vibrates eg @frequency of 2MHz with a given intensity. the acoustic impedance of skin adjusted to fat acoustic impedance with the fluid.
- uses interfaces between tissues with different acoustic impedances to generate an image.

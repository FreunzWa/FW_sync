###### Force and motion
    force - the cause of the motion
    acceleration - the effect of the force, changing motionof the object.
    model: simplified version of reality but as close as possible to simulating the powers at play in reality. reduce complexity of the problem to the point of being able to be understood. 

# Newton laws of motion - basis for classical mechanics
- remain at rest/ uniform motion unless acted upon
- body's change in momentum is equal to the net force acting on it (impulse)
- equal and opposite reactive force when a force is applied
- forces obey the principle of superposition

- in considering forces on object, model is to consider object a point particle. 
[uniform motion; constant speed, no acceleration]
[per; ratio between two quantities, x for each y]

# Displacement
- a vector comprised of two scalar quantities
    + distance scalar
    + direction scalar

# Velocity
- rate of change of position of object, rate of displacement change
- vector as specifies booth direction and magnitude specifiese the speed to fully characterise motion of object.

# Linear motion
- motion diagram, changing position with respect to velocity
- instantaneous velocity calculated from an equation using calculus if the equation of the curve is known otherwise using tangent/ limit 


# Vectors
- can only be of zero magnitude of all of the ocmponents of the vector are zero
- cannot add a scalar and vector, however can multiply the sscalar through the vector by changing the magnitude proportionally.



# Momentum
- impulsive force: an impulsvie force is a force that is applied over a period of time (force vs time graph) so that the impulse J is given by the area under the curve. the impulse determines the effect that the force will have on the object. thus Impulsve forces of different shapes that have the same area will have the same effect on the object. 
- average force is the impulsve curve that has the same impulse as the given force with constant force applied throughout the duration of the impulse.
- momentum: mass * velocity. vector quantity, points in same direction as velocity vector. 
- impulse momentum theorem is that the impulse deliverede will be equivalent to the change in momentum of the object based on the change in velocity (mass being equal)
- total momeentum of a system is equivalient to the vector sum of the component particles.
- at brief interaction bewteen bodiies == the forces between them are quite large.
- impulse approximation: does nto take into account interaction forcees @the impulse forces are much higher.
- conservation of momentum: 

# Acceleratioin down a ramp
- has downwards force from gravity, which can be broken into components, one of which is in the direction of actual movement and acceleration, then use trig to calculate the magnitude of each vector

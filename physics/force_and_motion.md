###### Force and motion
    force defined as interactitons push/ pull between separate objects - measure and describe the interacttion. mathematical model of force is a way to quantitatively describe interaction between two object, and force is the cause of acceleration (an imbalance in the sum of forces, by N2)
    force - a vector with mag and dir that causes motion
    acceleration - the effect of the force, changing motionof the object.
    model: simplified version of reality but as close as possible to simulating the powers at play in reality. reduce complexity of the problem to the point of being able to be understood.

# Force
- vector of mag and dir that describes interaction between objects, and acceleration of objects
- non contact vs contact forces .
    + non-contact are the 4 forces (aka the field forces), or the "fundamental forces": weak and strong nuc force, EM force, gravity
        * EM force is the force repsonsible for holding electrons to nuclkeii, holding atoms together in molcules. van der waals, covalent, ionic etc are all examples of EM force.
        * strong nuclear force bewteen protons and neutrons, repels the repulsive EM force. the strongest of the 4 fundamental force, but very short range.
        * weak nuclear force: emission of beta particles, even shorter range than the strong nuclear force.
    + other forces are "convenience forces", non fundamental forces. eg tension, push, normal force
        * convenience forces are all contact forces, and thus EM in nautre, acting like spring forces as a resistance to compression - basically like macroscopic springs in a bed mattress for instance.
- interaction pair (newtons 3rd law)
- applied force:
    + pushing force that object applies on another object
- friction force:
    + parallel to the surface due to contact between two objects.
    + results from EM interaction, actually attraction between atoms. @gets rougher, there will be more contact points between the two objects == more friction.
    + force that opposes existing moition sliding of object across a surface. kinetic friction ius less.
- normal force
    + pushing force exerted on an object @surface (eg pushing hand against wall or standing on floor), a force which acts perpendicularly to that surface.
- kinetic friction
- static friction
- restoring force (spring force): restores object back to original state
- tension force
    + aka pulling force, equal to the force on the rope. tendons are often modelled as massless strings. 
- Spring force
    + returning to equilibrium after stretching or compresssion
- Drag
    + interaction between medium and object moving through it. 

# Newton laws of motion "Newtonian mechanics" - the basis for classical mechanics 
- remain at rest/ uniform motion unless acted upon
- body's change in momentum is equal to the net force acting on it (impulse)
- equal and opposite reactive force when a force is applied
- forces obey the principle of superposition
- in considering forces on object, model is to consider object a point particle. 
- N1 (law of inertia)
    + no acceleration (translational equilibrium) if the forces acting are balanced - i.e. net force is 0. 
    + to change velocity, massive objects require more force -- inertia. 
    + only applies for inertial frames of mass (an inertial frame is a reference frame that has uniform velocity). thus does not hold acceleratede reference frames
- N2
    + in the principia chose to write the equation as F net = dp/ dt. the reason for this is that it takes into account variable mass interactions (such as squid escaping from predator)
    + acceleration is directly linearly proportional and in same direction as the applied force
    + the amount of acceleration produced is inversely linearly proportional to the mass of the object
- N3
    + interaction paiir so that force of a on b is equal and opposite direction to force of b on a.
[uniform motion; constant speed, no acceleration]
[per; ratio between two quantities, x for each y]

# Displacement
- a vector comprised of two scalar quantities
    + distance scalar
    + direction scalar

# Velocity
- rate of change of position of object, rate of displacement change
- vector as specifies booth direction and magnitude specifiese the speed to fully characterise motion of object.

# Linear motion
- motion diagram, changing position with respect to velocity
- instantaneous velocity calculated from an equation using calculus if the equation of the curve is known otherwise using tangent/ limit 


# Vectors
- can only be of zero magnitude of all of the ocmponents of the vector are zero
- cannot add a scalar and vector, however can multiply the sscalar through the vector by changing the magnitude proportionally.



# Acceleratioin down a ramp
- has downwards force from gravity, which can be broken into components, one of which is in the direction of actual movement and acceleration, then use trig to calculate the magnitude of each vector

# motion in two dimensions
- simply play n dimension problem down into constistuent dimensions and study motion in each dimension

# uniform circular motion
- draw coordinate systme so that motion is tangential to the circular motion, the other direction has zero magnitude @perpendicular azxis to teh direction of motin
- zero tangential acceleration == most simplistic
- velocity not constant @the direction is constanytl changing directions
- centripetal acceleration - acceleration that points towards the centre of the circular path
- centripetal acceleration
    + a = 4 pi^2 * r / T^2

# Forces on extended object
- torque:
- angular freqeuncy:
    + w, a scalar measure of rotation nrate. degrees/ radiaans per second rrotated. similar to regular frequency by factor of 2*pi, as one full rotation is equal to 2*pi rotations.

###### Formulae

# Mechanics
- Spring force
    + Hooke's law: F(spring) = -k * displacement (k is the spring constant)

# Atomic model
- n = N/Na

# Gases
- pV = nRT
- pV/T = pV/T for a constant mass process
- W{gas} = p * change in volume

# Thermal expansion
- dVolume = B*Vi*dTemperature
    + B is the coefficient of volume expansion, dependent on material in question
- dLength = a*Li*dTemperature

# Heat
- specific heat {c - heat capacity}: amnt of heat in joules that raises the temperature of 1 Kg of a substance by 1 K
    + Q = mass*c*dTemp
- heat of transformation
    + Q +/- Mass * {L} - L is the specific heat of transformation, either vaporisation or fusion with a subscript v or f for each. either positive or negative value depending on whether heat needs to be removed or added
- conduction
    + rate of heat transfer through conduction:
        * rate of Q = (kA/L)*dT
        * kA is the measure of thermal conductivity - measured in W/m*K, specific for each material, diamond transmits heat extremely rapidly, even more than silver which has the highest thermal conducitvity of any metal.
        * the units are in W because the rate of heat transfer Q is J/s, which is power\
- radiation heat transfer
    + heat transfer rate:
        * Q  = emissivity * s * A * T^4
            - emissivity is a degree to which a substance emits radiation
            - A is the surface area of the substance
            - sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant
            - large dependence on the temp of an object to radiate heat

# Fluids
- pressure of liquid with density p at depth d
    + p = p0 + pgd
- buoyancy force
    + Fb = density of fluid * volume of fluid * gravitational constant
- equation of continuity: v1A1 = v2A2
- Bernoulli's equation
- viscosity equation
    + dPressure = 8*pi*coefficiieent of viscosity * L

# Waves
- equations for simple harmonic motion
- maximum displacement wiith dampening motion
    + x max (t) = Amplitude * e^(-t/Tau) - tau is hte time constant -- essentially measusres the lifetime of an oscillation

###### Formulae

# Atomic model
- n = N/Na

# Gases
- pV = nRT
- pV/T = pV/T for a constant mass process
- W{gas} = p * change in volume

# Thermal expansion
- dVolume = B*Vi*dTemperature
    + B is the coefficient of volume expansion, dependent on material in question
- dLength = a*Li*dTemperature

# Heat
- specific heat {c}: amnt of heat in joules that raises the temperature of 1 Kg of a substance by 1 K
    + Q = Mc*dTemp
- heat of transformation
    + Q +/- Mass * {L} - L is the specific heat of transformation, either vaporisation or fusion. either positive or negative value depending on whether heat needs to be removed or added

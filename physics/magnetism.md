###### Magnetism
    magnetic force and field are also vector, however the scalar charge present in electrostatics is replaced by a vecetor current dennsity (current combined with a unit vector that pointns in teh direction oft eh motion of positive charges)
[cyclotron resonancep; describes interaction of esxternral forces with charged particles expeirencing amangetic field already moving on a circular path. a cyclotron is a cricular particle accelerator that uses oscsillating electric field tuned ot this resosnance to add kinetic energy to charge particlese.]
[magnetise; to magnetise an objecct apply a magnetic field to an object, the domains will align to the magnetic field, it will last for a certain amoutn oftime.]

# Magnetic force and field @electric current
- magnetism is cuased by electric currents, just as electricity is caused @electric charges
- Ampere's law
    + magnetic force is the interaction between two electrtic currents. 
    + states that the magnetic force between two current carrying conductors is proportional to each current, and inveresely proprortional to the distance betweeen teh conductors.. and proportional to teh length of the conductor
    + Fmag/l ~ I1*I2/d
    + the magnetic field is directed perpendicular to direction in which current flows
- magnetic field
    + as electric field was introudced  by elmiinntg the point charge from colombs law in place of a probe charge with samples the electric field at a given point
    + eliminate one of the conductors, instead using a probe current that serves only to sample the magnetic field.
    + strenght is measured in units T, Tesla. The magnetic field is denoted B.
- magnetic force
    + charged particle with a non-zero velocity moving through a mangetic field will have a force applied to it (as it is acting an electric current)
    + F(m) = charge * (cross product of the velocity of the particle and the magnitude of the electric field vectors)
    + use the right hand rule: velocity (pointing int eh direction the particle is going), the resultant F(m) force due to the magnetic field is the thumb (forcing the thumb up)
    + can use left hand for negatively charged particles
    + the angle between the moving charged particle and the magnetic field is not always 90! represented @theta:
        * F(m) = qv * sin(theta) * (B - the magnitude of the magnetic field)
    + however the resultant force is AWLAYS perp to teh magnetic field and the velocity.
    + maximum Fm is given @90 degrees, would be 0 at 180 degrees (sin 0  = 0 )
    + parallel wires with current moving in same direction will be forced together (use the other ight hand rule)
        * flow together, go together
        * flow apart, go apart.

# Electromagnetic induction
- the ability of a magnnetic field to create current in a conductor. 
- simialrly to current producing a magnetic field
- showed a current temporarily. 
- magnetic flux is how a conducting material is affected by a magnetic field.
- the product of strenght of the mangetic field * surface area perpendicular to teh magnetic field (the 'amount' of magnetic field going through a ggiven area ). 
- only induction when there is achange in teh magnetic flux (the strenght of the electric current will be proportional to the change iin flux). can continuue to get a electric current by alterring the elctric current. or can change the orientation of the surface continuosuly to generate a current.
- how generators work 

# Magnetic field of a dipole
- eg a magnet (like a compass needle). 
- good analogue is electric loop with generating a mangeticc field - we now have a clear north and south
- not differennce between an electric dipole and a magnetic dipole. 
- never have a magnetic monopole - always have a nonrth and south. respond to magnetic fields 
- earth dipole north is poitned towardxs magnetic southh

# Magnetic field of wire
- found that current produces a mangetic field - originally tired to use stationary charges to generate a magnetic field
- magnetic field goes around the wire circumfrentially.
- again use right hand rule, with the thumb going in the direction fo teh current, and the fingers curling with the magnetic field.

# Standard drawing of mangeitc fields
- @magnetic fields directed perp to electric currents/ fields, require 3rd dimensin. the standard way of doing this is to use arrow heads (a cricle with a dot) for magnetic field coming out of the paper and a plus sign (for the tail fo the arrow) for magnetic field going into the paper.

[collimate; to make parallel]
# Aston's mass spectrometer
- 1919 was the first mass spec device
- combined a source of ions with two devices:
    + 1. a velocity selector based on a magnetic and electric field
    + 2. a mass selector based on a amagnetic field
- the source of ions is a hot filament that ioonises molecules, the split by gas chromoatopgraphy. the ions travelt hrougjh sltis (to confine a beam of particles, electrically charged to accelerate thions)
- first pass through S1/S2, collimating and accelerated
- then pass through velocity seeleector (Wien filter)
- Wien filter`
    + ions with variable velocities pass through the sleector, all parallel to one another.
    + contains a magnetic field and an electric field perp to one antoehr. and perp to direction of motion of charged particles.
    + select particles of a given velocity @using netwons first law, when the electric field (due  to charge) and magnetic field (due to velocity) cancel out.
- sector magnet
    + next part differetntiates based on mass, @now all ions have the same speed the only thing that determines the radius of the arc travelled is the mass of the particle.

# Faraday's law

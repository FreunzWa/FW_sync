[Gibb's free nergy; energy that is availablle to do work. the thrermodynamic potential tyhat can nbe used ot claculate the maximum of rerversible work that may be performed by a thermodynamic system at constant pressure annd temperature. good for detemrining if we have a spontaneous reaction, if dG < 0, then spontenaouse, if dG is larger == not sponhtaneouis. Gibbs free energy determined @enthalpy - the amoun tof internal enrrgy - and the entropy. dG = dH - T*dS]
# Nernt's equation
    governs all electrochemical phenomena at a membrane+-
    specifies the ratio of the concenration wwithin thhe interstitium and the axoplasm proportional to the electricla potential difference betweeen the two sides of the memabrnre.

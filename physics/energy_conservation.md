###### Energy and conservation
    momentum - aka linear momentum or translational momentum. product of mass and velocity.
        Newton's second law states that a body's rate of change of momentum is eqeual to net force operating on it. 
[inteertial frame of reference: possesses the property that ]
[ centre of mass; COM of a system of objects is a positioin in space described by a vector, ]
[rigid body; continuous object which is modelled mathematically as continuous discreet particles whose relative positions are time independent. -- thus the distance between any two points on a rigid bodyd remaiin constant in time]
[work]
[energy enables a system to do work, can be stored many ways]
[isolated systems; systems which do not exchange energy or matter with surroudnings, eg calorimeter, closed insulated containers]

# Energy
- a systems' stored capability to do work
- energy of isolated system is conserved
- can only be transferred through heat or work
- major forms:  
    + kinetic energy
    + potential energy (sotred  in the position of an object) -- meechanical energies
        * GPE
        * Electrical PE
        * Elastic PE
    + Thermal energy
    + chemical energy
    + latent heat (stored in the phase of matter)


# Work
- reefers to the amount of energy that is transferred into or out of a system, this energy can be used to push a weight through suitable passive linkages, and is thus externally measurable
    + types of work forces: electromagnetic, gravitational, pressure/ volume, mechanical varialv.es
- ?mechanical equivalent of heat
- scalar, independent of the direction, as the product is vector x vector, a scalar product
- Power is the rate at which work is done
- Kiinetic energy work
    + work is equal to the change in kienetic eneryg as given by the kinetic energy equation



# Momentum
- momentum will be conserved in every dimension of movement (x,y,z). as derived from F=ma
- impulsive force: an impulsvie force is a force that is applied over a period of time (force vs time graph) so that the impulse J is given by the area under the curve. the impulse determines the effect that the force will have on the object. thus Impulsve forces of different shapes that have the same area will have the same effect on the object. 
- average force is the impulsve curve that has the same impulse as the given force with constant force applied throughout the duration of the impulse.
- momentum: mass * velocity. vector quantity, points in same direction as velocity vector. 
- impulse momentum theorem is that the impulse deliverede will be equivalent to the change in momentum of the object based on the change in velocity (mass being equal)
- total momeentum of a system is equivalient to the vector sum of the component particles.
- at brief interaction bewteen bodiies == the forces between them are quite large.
- impulse approximation: does nto take into account interaction forcees @the impulse forces are much higher.
- conservation of momentum: 
    + for a given system of objects the total momentum is always conserved.
    + if external fortcrces
- conservation laws are a good and convenient way to answer problems where there is a clear before and after picture and no externally acting forcese unless they cancel out 
    + important to choose the system so that minimises externall acting forces to consider only internal ones that may cancel out -- such as complex interactions such as friction etc.
- explosions
    + opposite of collisioin, all internal forces. still applies conservation of momentum
- inelastic collisions
    + two objectst hat collide and the move together is an inelastic collision -- perfectly inelastc if completely stuck together
- momentum and collisions in 2 dimensions
    + conservation fo momentum in each directioin
- angular momentum
    + basically the same but with mass as inertia and velocity as angular velocity
    + momentum for circular motion not conserved @changing direction
    + use alpha symbol for angular acceleration. a = Torque / moment of inertiia
    + angular momentum {L} = Inertia * angular velocity
    + conservatin of angular momentum until a torque applied to change angular velocity

# Centre of mass
- allows application of newtonian mechanics to macroscopic objects usually modelled as point particels. by calculating the centre of mass its movement can be calculated assuming rigid body -- that is the x,y,z positions of its particles are time independent.

# Kinetic energy
- K = mv^2 * 1/2
- relation between K and temperature of a gas
    + T = (2/3)*(Kavg/ kB) - kB is boltzmann constant

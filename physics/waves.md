###### Waves
[vibration; oscillating (reversing and alternating) motions aaround an equilibrium point)]

# Oscillations
- equilibrium position; @no net forc ==  stabilisies to equil position. a restoring force such as gravity acts to stabililse the object back to equilibrium. resting force higher @further away from equilibrium    
    + linear restoring force is a force whose magnitude depends linearly to the distance displaced -- example of spring.
- oscillation - repetitive motion
    + period: the amount fo time taken for the motion to repeat -- symbol T
- frequency: number of cycles per time, will be inverse proportion to the period. -- symbol f with SI units Hz which is second^-1
- eg of ECG repeating, thjis is an oscilllation @repeating pattern.
    + spring's motion is given by SMH @displaced == linear restoring force to equilibrium position where there is no force acting, however continues @inertia of the object== negative displacement.
    + pendulum's motion is also simplee harmonic
- sinusoidal @cosine/ sine shape to the graph -- a sinusoidal graph is termed simple harmonic motion -- SHM
    + amplitude is maximal displacement from the point of equilibrium
- uniform circular motion
    + is related dto SMH @when projected onto one dimension they can be characterised by SMH -- that is , a single dimenesion of the motion of the moving point is given by sMH equations
- energy in SMH
    + 
- damped oscillation
    + @loss of energy due to air resistance/ friction of moving components. the drag is higher @higher velocities so the drag highest at the start of the motion whenn amplpitude is the highest.
- drriven oscillation
    + oscillator when subject to external force that prompts an oscilllation is a driven oscillation. 
    + natural frequency is whne allowed eto oscillate without exteernal forces {f0}
    + driving frequency is when it is allowed to oscillate under action of external force. {fext}
    + when the natural and driving frequencies are in resonance the response will be greater and thus the amplitude will be maxiimum here. the degree to which the amplitude increases will depend on the system dampening.


# Waves and moving waves
    mechanical deformation caused @medium travels as a pertubation from the source (wave)
    either
        longitudinal (propagation direction collinear with direction in which the deformationoscillates.)
[Harmonic waves; a wave that it is described by a sinusoidal function @caused by an elastic vibration char @Hooke's law. ]
[Standing wave; aka stationary wave. oscillates but peak amplitude does not move in space. antinodes (max) and nodes (minimum) @oscillation fo teh wave. can occur @medium moving in opposite direction ot the wave OR at interference between two waves trvel @opposite directions OR at resonance (most common cause)]
- wave model
    + model common features to all waves - ie sound waves, light waves, radio waves, water waves.
    + mechanical waves
        * motion of the medium through which the wave movese. disturbance of the medium, created initially by the source, 
        * wave speed v.
        * there is a transfer of energy without net movement of the medium. thus there is a traansfer of energy without trasnfer of any substance from the sourcce
    + some waves require medium, some do not
    + EMR
        * waves of an electromagnetic field, include all light in spectrum. require no mateiral medium, travel through a vaccuum. 
    + matter waves
        * elecrons / atoms have wave like characteristics
    + longitudinal waves/ transverse waves
        * longitudinal: propagating waves' direction collinear with the plane of vibration
        * transverse: propagating wave's direction is perpendicular to the plane of the vibration
- @particles interact with eachother == local vibrations of particles == affect other nearby particles == propagating wave. 

# Sound
- displacement of a given gas element (D) depends on phase of the wave
- @solids and liquids are compressible to some degree == waves can travel through these materials. the speed of sound is detemrine d@the bulk modulus -- the more compressible
- speed of sound
    + @higher temperature of air == air molecules haev higher kientic energy == able to vibrate more rapidly == more rapid conduction of sound waves == sound travels faster the hotter hte emdium is
    + speed of sound faster @througgh solid object @all atoms are chemically related tthrough bonds to eachother == more direct physical interaction. for a gas the particles have to get into vicinity first to interact.


# Differences in trasnverse and longitudinal wave behaviour
- polarisation

# Harmonic waves
- waves produced by a mechanical system that obeys hooke's law are harmonic waves.

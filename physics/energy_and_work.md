###### Energy and work
[energy; a capability of a system to do work, or transfer enrgy as heat. energy exists in many forms. work energy is energy that can be transferred through the use of GPE and KE]
[thermal energy; enery stored in the temperature of a asystem. this energy cannot be identified as work]
[work; trasnfer of mechanical energy betwen two systems.]
[heat; transfer of thermal energy between two systems.]

# Signs of energy transfer
- energy transfer into a system either as thermal energy or work (mehcniacal) energy is designated positive sign as these increase the stored total energy (sum of potential mechanical energy and thermal energyu). energy transferred out is negative.

# Work by a gas
- W = -p*V for a constant pressure system
- if the pressure varies then a V-p curve must be used, and the absolute work is the area under the curve in the pV diagram.

# First law of thermodynamics
- conservation of energy, the change in stored energy for an isolated system is 0.
- the sum of all energy forms in a closed system changes by the amounts of heat and work that flow between system and the environment

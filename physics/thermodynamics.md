###### Thermodynamics
    describe physical properties materials
    phases of matter: solid definite shape with strong spring like molecular bonds, liquid weak bonds permitting motion but still remain close together, gas particles move freely.

# Atomic model of matter
[atomic mass <u>: protons + neutrons, the mass relative to 12-C]
[atomic number : number of protons, identifies what element it is]
[molecular mass: sum of all the atomic masses of thee constituent atom]
[mole: measurement of the amount of substance in moles; 1 mole of substance is 6.022*10^23. Avogadro's number is 6.022*10^23 particles per mole.]
- number of n moles in a substance containing N basic particles is given by:
    + n = N/Na (N is the number of particles, Na is avogadro's number). this comes from the definition of a  mole - the amount of substance contained in 12 grams of Carbon 12
- molar mass: the mass in grams of 1 mol of substance. the heavier the constituent elements/ molecules are the higheer the molar mass will be. 
- allows conceptualisation and analysis of chemical reactions occurring at the atomic level to macroscopic levels that are worked wwith. allows measurement of a substance so that equal number of atoms of certain substances are obtained. 
- calculate the mass of a single atom through avogadro's relationship

# Atomic model of an ideal gas
- highly comppressible @++space between particles so less repulsive forces. 
- random  motion of point particles, moving at different speeds
- ideal gas is a hypothetical gas whose molecules occupy negliglbe space and havee no interacttions, a model for understanding the way that gases behave
- temp is related to average kinetic energy of thee atoms, to calc add all thee kinetic energfiese of all of the particles and take an average..
- rms (root mean speed) is taken forom the average kinetic energy determinede by a given temperatu7re of the gas in question and descrbes the average speed particles are travellling.
- pressure
    + p = F/A
    + a gas exerts a force of magnitude F = pA, the component of the force that is perpendicular to the surface of the container. the higher the pressure the higher the outward force is.
    + SI unit for pressure is the Pascal, one pascal is a very small pressure so usu use kilo pascal.
    + global atmospheric pressure at sea level iis 101.3 kPa
    + ideal gas law:
        * pV = nRT
        * relating the key determinants of the behaviour of a gas. shows that pressure is proportional to the number of particles, temperature and inversely proportional to the volume of the gas.
        * R = 8.31 J /(mol*K)
    + STP: standard temperature and pressure. common reference point for studying gases. 1 atm pressure and 273 K.
- conservation of particles in gas
    + allows simplification of the ideal gas law, in that n is unchanged. allows comparison between intiital and final states:
        * pV/T initial = pV/T final
    + pV diagrams
    + constant volume process
        * eg raising the temperature incresaes the temperature without changing the volume if the container is rigid. can be represted on a pV diagram by a straight upwards line as thee pressure is increased
    + guage pressure: this is relative to the atmospheric pressure so the absolute pressure of the measured gas will be higher.
        * 1 atm = 14.7 psi
    + constant pressure processes
        * isobaric process, this is allowed for with a piton where a tight fitting cap is allowede to move up and down freely so as the pressure is allowed to be constant, while the volume and temperature are permitted to change. the piston will always reach an equilibrium between teh external atmospheric force on the top of teh piston and the internal force from teh gas within the piston
        * on a pV diagram the isobaric process appears as a horizontal lineon the pV diagram
    + isothermal process - constant temperature process
        * apppears as a hyperbola on a pV diagram
        * eg piston that is heated/ cooled to a constant external temperature, allowing the pressure and volume to change.
        * an 'isotherm' is the name of the graph of an isothermal process.
    + gases doing work
        * W gas = pressure gas * change in volume
        * a gas must chang ein volume to do work
    + adiabatic processes
        * eg @use wheel pump == the pump gets warm @doing work on a gas increasses the thermal energy (first law of thermodynamics) 
        * an adiabatic process is a processs which has no time for a transfer of thermal energy with the environment, instead the energy is transferred to teh surroundings only inthe form of work

# Thermodynamic processes
- isochoric process (constant volume process)
    + process that takes place at constant volume, usu requirea rigid container. unusual in biological systems. 
    + a work for an isochoric process is 0 as the change in volume is 0, thus the energy change is totally caused by the change in heat energy. 

# thermal expansion of solids and liquids
+ change in volume @change in temperature (eg in thermometer)
+ @kinetic energy == atoms wriggle faster == more variatiion in location function == longer bonds length on average ==  expansion of the solid.
+ model
    * most substances volume linearly related to changes in temperature
    * change in volume dependent on the cooefficient of volume expansion, specific to the material in ueqtison @depends on bond in the mateerial
    * similarly for the length of an object:
        - uses a different constant - {a} the cooefficient of linear expansion
+ special property of water is to shrink as it is coolled but as it approaches 0 degrees (from below 4 degreees onwards) the ice expands slightly as the ordereed arrangmenet of hydrogven bonds form. very important for life @ice is buoyant as a result of being less dense.

# Heat
- specific heat: the amount of heat reequired to raise the temperature of 1 kg of substance by 1 K
    + symbol for specific heat is {c}
    + water has a very large thermal inertia, it has a very high specific heat - 4190 J/(kg*K)
    + heating the body from 37 to 39 degrees requires a lot of energy - about the same energy to work 2 kilometres
- phase changes
    + during phase change the tempareture remains fixed as the bonds are broken and the phase change is completed.\, rather than speeding up the molecules.
    + this is why better to drop in ice cube to cool drink @first drink must expend energy breaking the bonds and then the heat transfer can take place.
    + a phase equilibrium is when a substance exists partially in two phases.
- heat of transformation
    + heat of fusion (solid / liquid)
    + heat of vaporisation (liquid/ gas)
- heat of vaporisation much higher @must break all of the bonds from liquid to gas phase, rather than just a few to increase the fluidity.
- evaporation 
    + phase change from liquid to gas beelow the boiling point. @variation in particles speeds - from the mean particle sspeed - 

# Thermodynamiics
- first lawa states that: energy and work can be used to add energy to a system. 

# Calorimetry
- quantitative measurement of heat transferred between systems or created by a reaction.
- uses the principle that there is always a conservation of heat between two interacting systems so that an increase in temp in one will be met with a correseponding decrease in the other.

# Heat transfer
- conduction
    + direct transfer of heat @physically touching
    + heat Q transferred higher @higher dTemp, ++surface area for contact, materials than conduct heat more readily eg metal, Q will be decreased if the rod connecting two objects is increasd
- convection
    + transfer of thermal energy by motion of a fluid. convection currents responsible for current and wind blowing. 
    + while air is a very good thermal insulator, if allowed to move through convection it can transmit heat rapidly. thus it is important to trap the air in small pockets to limit convectin -- what feathers and double glaze windows do
    + convection is much more rapid iin water than in air == more dangerous to be in cold wate
- radiation
    + electromagnetic waves absorbed, emittede
    + infra red is more readily absorbed so it perceiveed as being hot. however other wavelengths will also heeat objects that absorb them. IR radiation responsible fro 49% of teh heating of earth. 
    + however IR popularly associated with heat@because most objects will not emit enough in higher parts of the spectrum so IR is responsible for more heating.

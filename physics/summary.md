# Conversion of values
- 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h 

# Significant figures 
- state uncertainty about a quantity through sig figs; should match the lower specificity of the two numbers so that always decreasing number of significant figures as this is as precise as can be

# Scienfitic notation 

# Estimation notation
- ~ means order of magnitude of difference in estimation

# Quantities
- either a vector or scalar
    + scalar: quantities that are fully describied by the magnitude alone, that is it has no other chracteristics. the element can then be used to define a vector space.
    + vecttors/ tensors: quantities that are fully described by both magnitude and direction or more numbers to fully describe the object
- vector notation
    + letter with an arrow over the top because bold face is not practical as it is used in printed publication
- vector addition
    + tip to tail addition so that both scalar components are taken into account for the addition
- proportional quantities
    + if related by equation of the form: y = C*x
    + C is the proportionality constant
- quadratic relationship
    + two quantities are said to be in quadratic relationship if y is proportional to the squarre of x

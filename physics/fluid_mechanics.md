###### Fluid mechanics
    fluid is substance that changes shape to fill the container it is in
    @not in mechanical equilibrium == will flow.
    turbulent vs laminar flow
    consideration of fluids separated into static fluids and fluids in motion
[laminar flow; model for fluid flow without turbulence and is incompressible. no friction against the walls, collisions are all perfectly elastic conditions, no sound waves develop]
[for biophysics the problems often use blood vessels, the blood is the fluid and is modelled as an ideal fluid with laminar flow. otherwise use airways]
[viscosity; interaction between neigbouring layers of moving fluid in a direction perpendicular to flow lines]
[guage pressure; a pressure measured relatrive to air pressure. ]

# Newtonian fluid model
- incorporates a model for viscosity into the ideal fluid model
- refers to forces exerted by the fluid on the container
- developed @assumption of the laminar flow model "ideal dynamic fluid model". @a dense fluid cannot travel past solid wall without ++interactions. 
- @viscous forces == stress to flow at every point


# Flow rate
- denoted Q, either mass flow rate or volume flow rate
- Poiseuille's law. makes assumption that viscosity coefficient of the fluid is larger (inversely proportional value and flow cannot be infinite)

# Density
 - SI units are kg/m^3
 - density specific to substance so that all pure copper has same density.
 - many types of density, refers to degree to which there is a given measurement in a space or time, thus to be more specific use mass density


# Pressure
- liquid exerts force on wall of containers, similar to gas; p = F/A. pressure at every point the same @water particles pushing in all directions.
- presssure increases at the bottom of liquid in teh presence of gravity force @squeezed by mass on top
- hydrostatic pressure is thee force exerted at any given point within teh fliuid due to the force of gravity.
- connected liquid in hydrostatic equilibrium flows to the same height in all open regions of the container. -- water seeks own level
- pressure same at all points connected in a water system by horizontal line
- Pascal's principle - if pressure at any one point in an imncompressible fliud changed then pressure at every other point changes by the same amount
- pressure in a tube with two liquids:
    + cannot use the straight line rule, as with different fluids doese not connect levels of equal pressure nor must the open regions be the same height necessarily.

# Measuring pressure
- use of piston relative to atmospheric pressure
- manometers: U shaped tube connected to gas at one end and open tot eh air at the other end, usually filled with mercury

# Buoyancy
- bouyant force - upward force imparted by a fluid on objects. @increasing pressure with depth == and area simliar area top and bottom = force greater on the bottom imparted by the fluid 
- the buoyant force will be exactly equal to the weight of the volume of the displaced fluid (imagine a parcell of fluid) -- Archimede's principle: fluid exerts an upward buoyant force on an object, equalling the weight of the fluid displaced by the fluid.
- neutral buoyancy is when the object is in static equilibriumw with the surrounding fluid. 
    + object will have neutral buoyancy if it weighs the same as the fluid it displaces -- comparison of densitiese. eg oil floats on teh top of water.
- if an object floats it will continue to rise until the weight of displaced fluid is eequal to tehe weight of the submerged volume.


# Fluid dynamics
- general model for fluids
    + fluid is incompressible, even holds fairly well for gasses like air, @when gits a wall at high speed density only changes @ about 1 %
    + steady flow, no fluctuations -- callled laminar flow.
    + non viscous fluid. -- gases have very low viscosity, and many fluids are well approximated by being non viscous
- equation of continuity
    + v1*A1 = v2*A2 so that in narrower sections the fluid must move faster to make up for the fact that the area is lower, and in a set length of time we can create a volume, which must be equal and the only way to correct for this is to check the velocity of the moving fluid.
    + volume flow rate is the volume per second of fluid laving a vessel. "flow", measaued in m^3/s
    + during tapering sections/ sections which have changing cross sectional area== acceleration / deceleration of the fluid. accelerated at force of pressure exerted by fluyid pressed upon by the wlals.
    + the bernoulli effect is that of the pressure of a fluid decreases as it moves faster.
- streamline
    + the path traced by a particle of fluid (as seen in aerodynamics illustrations of aeroplanes)
- fluid element:    
    + small volume fo fluid, the shape of which changes @movement @equation of continuity and equal vlume

# Viscosity
- despite honey and waater similar density, honey ++viscous ==  reseistant to flow @intermolecular bonds
- the more viscous thee fluid is the more pressure that needs to be applied for it to continue flowing.
- an ideal fluid with viscosity = 0 will continue to move through the pipe without application of pressure.
- with temperature for many fluids the visccosity decreases rapidly
- poiseulle's equation: 
    + says that the closer the viscous fluid is to teh wall of the tube the slower that particle will move. to the point of touching the wall == does not move at all

# Sedimenmtation
- @different densities == different buoyant forces == separation into heterogenous systems. 
- decanting is when the solutions are separated basede on differential density.
- reach terminal speed when the net force of weight, buoyant force and drag force is 0 == moves at a terminal speed.

# Fluid surfaces
- work has to be done to increase the surface area of the fluid because fluids will coalesce due at the surface inward directed force that are not balanced -- net inwards force
- eg raindrop will always favor smallest shape -- the  sphere.
- bubbles contain higher pressure and is held in place by the surface tension of the bubblle.
- Laplace law in bioology

# Surface tension
[cohesion; attraction of similar molecules together - eg water molecules in a drop]
[adhesion; attraction of unlike molecules togethers]
- tendency of fluid interfaces to shrink to lowest SA. 
- depends on relative strength between cohesive and adhesive forces.
- water has very high surface tension due to hydrogen bonds
- units: Force per unit length OR energy per unit Area (surface energy -- which also applies to solidss)
- laplace law: due to surface tension, as teh radius of a curved fluid surface increases, the fluid pressure required to oppose surface tension will decrease. 

# Capillarity
- related to surface tension, decreases the surface area @inwards directed forces.
- water 'wets' glass because the formatioin of this interface requires less energy than with the  air-- opposite for mercury

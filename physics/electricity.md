###### Electricity
    electric force is a long range contact free funddamaental force that varies in magnitude with the inverse square law (Coulomb's law)
    cohesion @electrostatic attraciton between partial charges on a dipole w/ hydrogen bonds == strong cohesive force == surface tension (large for water @hydrogen bonds are)
[Faraday's method; simplying some electric systems problems by using an electric field]

# Electric charge and force
[point charge; a charged particle of negligible size]
[bohr radius; the separation distannce betwween 2 particels based on atomic radius]
[test charge; uised for purposes of drawing electric field lines for standardising - always positive unit charge, a single proton]
[probe charge; the mobile charge of interest in a problem]
- electric charge an intrinsic property of particles as is mass. two types of charge exist, designated pos annd nefative. 
- electric neutrality of matter @atoms compriseed of equal positive and negative charge @electrons and protonns. 

# Eelctric force
- electric force related @by electric charge, @stronger magnitude electric charge == stronger force, but force dimishes proportional to the square of the distance.
- F = |q||q|/r^2 * proportionality factor fo the permittivity of vaccuum. expresses the force that charge 1 exerts on charge 2.
- charge is quantized @the elementary charge is givenn by teh smallest amount of charge possible of an electron (1.6x10^-19)

# Newtons laws and charged objects
- considered just like other forces so that a point charge will be in static equilibrium @all of the forces acting oppose == net force of 0. application fo coulombs law, often calculate distannces or charges in a system. 
- Faradays approach: solves complexity of having many poitn charges in a system by just considering them all to have a nent effect: an electriic field. must assume so that the point charges do not move reealitve  == stationary electric field (electrostatics) the electric field is a vector field @a force field, with the force at each point being given by Coulomb's law

# Electric field
[charge density; p=Q/V, Q is the sum of all charges, V is the voluem of the system. C/m^3. this is used for systems that have free pointc rages which cannot move but distributed in 3 dimensions]
- allows calculation of the effect of an arrangement of charges at any opsition, without having to actually have the probe particle at that positoin
- Fel = qE (the units for E the electric field are N/C). the E is calculated from Coulomb's equation essentially without the second charge in teh eequation. the r term becomes the distance away from teh point charge where we are claculating the strenght of thfe electric field.
- electric field of stationary point charge
    + electric field vector field pointed away from a positive charge and towards a negative charge.
- electric field of a dipole (two opposite charges of equal magnitude separated by a distance to generate an electric field.)
    + sum of two components of dipole, thus calculate the Electric field due to eeach element of hte dipole independently and then calculate the net Electrirc field.
    + the electric field of a dipole drops proportionally to 1/r^3, more rapidly than the electric field of a single charge. (1/r^2 in that case)
- electric field of charged parallel plates
    + mathematically simple electric fieeld. the surface charge density is simliar to charge density but is C/m^2.
    + eg of the charge density on either side o the neuronal membrane.
    + the electric field betwween charge plates is independennt of positionn, proportional to the surface charge deensity, inveerse prop to the permittivity constnat.

# Electric dipole momennt
- product of chrage and distance defines the electric dipole moment. it is a measurement of hte polarity of a chemical bond within a molecule @separation fo charges.
    + mu = qd
- s



# Electric potential
    Electricl potential energy eg @linear opposite charged plate system. Thus a function fot eh strength fo teh electric field @for a point charge system the potential energy will be related by proportin factor 1/r^2
    in contrast to eh electric field, the electric potential is a scalar field 
    cannot measure electric rfields direclty, inteased use the poetnetial difference
- electric energy
    + total energy fo the system now inncludes gravitaitonal , kinetic and also electric potential energy.
    + electric potential energy very simliar to GPE for an opposite chargede plate system due to teh linear nature of the forces at play. for a more complex arrangemnent the dot product of vector sis used.
    + Volts ;  meaasuremenet for eleectric potenntial (iimportantly NOT electrical potential energy!), units are J/C thus gives the magnitude of energy exerted by a given Electric field per colouumb of charge of a givenm charged particle int eh system
- only potential differences matter for discussing real phyusical phenomena
- V denotes Electric potential, however voltage is actually referring to the potential differencce between two points iin space.

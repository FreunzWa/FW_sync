###### Elasticity and vibrations
    elastic and plastic systems
        bio elastic systems eg the sarcomere.

[potential energy: stored energy of an object based on its position. position is unfavorable as it has a high energy. high energy states unstable @no net work into the system to start them.]
[strain; change in shape/ size of an object]
[stress; force acting on teh surface of an extended objec0t, applied per surface area of the affected structure]
[Hooke's law; spring law -  that hte force to deform spring linearly proportional to the distance of deformation, holds true in general for objects subject to elastic deformations with delta x small in comparaison to maximum x displacmeent.]
[elastic systems; respond to external stress forces with linear deformation (called strain). elastic deformations are reversible]
[plastic systems; respods to external stress forces with non-linear strain. plastic deformations are not reversible.]
[hydraulics; engineering involving mechanical properties and use of liquids]

[elastic potential energy]

sigma sign used for stress (stress = F/A)
epsilon used for strain (think of it being a funny shape). strain = change in length/ total length

# Elasticity
- strain vs. stress
    + types of strain and types of stress
        * stretch (change length) @tensile stress
        * twisting (change in angle) @shearing stress
        * volume change (compression/ expansion) @hydraulic stress
    + an object is elastic if teh strain and stress are proportional to eachotehr.
        * eg when length change increases linearly with stress
        * proportionality factor "Young's modulus" constant for different systems. @large YM == hard material. 
        * blood vessels have very low YM so will change shae even @low forces
        * YM does not hold for excessive stretching - an elastic limit describes strain @strain threshold reached. 
- elastic deformations are reversible; when the stress is removed an elastic system will recover teh original shape.

# Shear stress and Twisting strain
- @two equal but opposite forces applied tangentially
- these deformations only apply @solids @gas and liquid cannot sustain tangential forces
- described @dx in the shearequation, related with factor G (the shear modulus)

# Hydraulic stress and compression strain
- possible for confined gases, solids and liquids.
- stress force applied from all sides. 
- elastic deformation @stress and strain are related linearly (reated by coefficient B, which is the bulk modulus - units Pa. steel has a high bulk modulus - therefore difficult to compress. gases have VERY low values @easily compressed.) 
- strain defined as relative volume change




# Plastic deformations
- irreversible changes in teh structure of an object when the elastic part of the stress-strain relationship is passed @certain threshold. 
- threshold corresponds to microaberrations and bond breaking == permanent deformation. 
- this point is teh ultimate strength point, past this point approaches total rupture very quickly without further increasea in stress

# Stress-strain curve
- curve of strain % with degree of Stress (in Pascals as stress is force/area applied). 
- differs for different tissues

# Biological examples of elastic systems
- eg sarcomere
    + @sarcomere stretched == cannot contract as much @decreased overlap of thin and thick filaments
- bone
    + s-s curve similar to steel. can only withstand strain of about 2% before material rupture. 
- blood vessel
    + able to withstand significant strain before rupture (>100%) @significant deformability.
    + collagen has a high bulk modulus, hich increases with strain
- aorta
    + windkessel
        * @puslatile flow variation == enlarges @systolic beat == holds more blood volume. @falls pressure == decrease in strain == further force for the blood to overcome flow resistance.
- aneurysms
    + @aneurysmal @laplace law and bernoulli law (equation of continuity == local increase in blood pressure) == higher strain for a given increase in blood pressure.

# Hooke's law
- describes the linear regime on the stress-strain curve. applies only in the 'elastic' regime of the materials s-s curve. 
- in general use for elastic systems but originally @spring systemes where there is an elastic restoring force 
- quantifies a linear restoring force that is porpotional to the displacmeent. thus the stress and strain are prroportion linearly in the elastic regime.

# Parameters of repetitive motion (using the potential energy of the system to calculate the amplitude and the maximumm velocity.)
- amplitude is max displacmeent. for a spring, when object reaches amp == no kientic energy, all converted into elastic potential energy.
- further, @displacmenet is 0, all of the energy is converted into kinetic energy to calculate hte max speed.
- can use the Spring potential energy and Kinetic equations 

# Harmonic motion
- SMH - object oscillates around point of mech equilibrium , with an angular frequency and period

# Applications to chemistry of SMH
- vibration

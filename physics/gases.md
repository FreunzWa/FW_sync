###### Gases
    bio: respiratory gases, and good model for understanding thermodynamics and thermal physics
    spirometer; emasures gas volume in teh lungs, measures the volume changes in teh lungs.
[Charles' law; ideal gas expands linearly when the temperature is increased]
[adabiatic; in an adabiatic prcoess energy is trasnferred between systems only as work - thus no heat energy is transferred. eg quick expansion of a ags with no time for ehat transfer]

# Gas parametes
- volume, pressure, temperature

# pV diagrams
- 

# Ideal gas model
- relationship beteween volume, pressure, temperature and amount of gas substance. its quantitative descripttion is the ideal gas law - a combination fo boyels and charle's
- an empirical model @based on reserarch and experiemnt 
    + Boyle's law: gas volume and pressure are inversely proportional, so that the product is constnat (for an isothermal process)
    + Charle's law: for an isobaric process product of volume and temperature is constant.
- ideal gas law:
    + relates V, P, T. the constant confirmed experimentally through measusring the volume of gas at varying pressure and temperature.
    + pV = nRT

# Kinetic gas theory
- definition of a gas as a mechanical system to describe quantititaviely amount of contained eneergy in teh system. 
- composed of randomly movcing point particles whose only interactions are perfectly elastic collisions. breaks down @low or very high temperatures.
- best models monatomic gases  (noble gases) @these have fewer interactions nad rotations of particlees.
- 4 properties of kinetic gas theory
    + 1. individual volumes of particles are negligible
    + 2. gas consists of very large number of identical particles]
    + particles in random motion
    + only interaction sbetween particles and walls or betweeen particles and particles are perfectly elsatic collisionhs

# Motherboard parts
    aka mainboard
- PCI slot (peripheral component interconnect). aka conventional PCI
    + either 32/ 64 bits, connects hardwware devices to mobo. 
- system bus
    + 
- nonvolatile BIOS memory
    + small memory on pc mobo used to store BIOS settings. 
    + volatile CMOS RAM, powered by the CMOS battery to store the data. after system loses power does not store the settings.
    + the CMOS battery lasts for 10 years. most common version is the CR2032 3V battery
    + lithium battery is not rechargeable
    + @replace the lithium battery == system tiume and BIOS settings return to default.
- BIOS chips
    + basic input output system chips
    + non volatile firmware that perfrosm hardware intiialisation during booting process.
    + preinstaalled on the mobo.
    + first software to run @power on.
- south bridge
    + one of teh two chips in teh core logic chipset on a PC motherboard.
    + implements slower capabilities of the motherboard
    + not directly connected to the CPU
    + northbridge tiees the CCPU to southbridge
- north bridge
    + aka host bridge. northbridge directly connected to cpu via the front side bus. 
    +

# Antikythera mechanism
- greek analogue computer
- used to predict astronomical positions and eclipsees for calendar decades in advance. possibly could even measure the irreegular orbit of tehe moon (higher velocity at perigree).
- knowledge of techcnocoly lost for 1600 years until 1400s.
- used to track 4 year cycle of athletic games
- retrieved @sea 1901
- contains gears, largest 14 cm diameter
- on the surface had all 365 days. 
- by turning handle could get exact position of the moon adn sun for any calendar day. 
- however someitmes had limited accuracy. @looseness of the mechanical components and deeficienecies in greeks undersaanding of the planetary movmeents (three body problem)

# Charles babbage
- originated the concept of programmable computer. fathere of the computer. 
- several of invention on display in science museum in london
- Difference engine
    + automatic mechanical calculator. 
- Analytical enginge
    + complete with ALU, control flow with conditional branching and loops, integrated memory.
    + never able to complete construction, completed a small version prior to death.
    + the first general computer was actually the Z3 came 100 years later.

###### RNNs & LSTM


# RNN
- generalisation of feedforward neural network that has an internal memory. performs same function for every input, while the ouput depends on the past one computation. after producing the output the output is sent back into the RNN. 
- used when the data is assumed to be dependent on the previoous ones.
- may be used with convolutionla layers to extend the pixel neighbourhood
- vanishing graident problem

# LSTM
- LSTM - long short term memory
- modified verison of RNN making it easier to remember pas tdata. 
- vanishing graident is resovled in this implementation

###### AI basics
    aka machine intelligence (contrast to natural intelligence)
    AI is about automating intelligent processes to perform tasks.
    some forms of weak AI are no longer generally considered AI because they are so basic -- this is called the AI effect: encapsulated by "AI is whatever has not beed done yet" -- i dispute this i like to consider basic systems like calculators has possessing some form of basic weak intelligence.

# terms used to describe the type of AI 
- weak OR strong
    + weak = less than human intelligence, even if learning is involved.
    + strong = can learn to levels equal to human intelligence
- general OR narrow
    + general = implies sentience/ consciousness/ actual intelligence. means can perform not necessarily programmed to perform.
    + narrow = implies algorithmic/ predefined functionality in onen particular area that it was designed for.

- WNAI
    + calculator/ operating system algorithms etc. these algorithms certainly are no where near as smart as human (the one that programmed it), and perform very narrow tasks and cannot learn new ones. preprogrammed is the key term - no capability for learning.
- SNAI
    + capable of 'learning' within its own field to potentially superhuman levels (therefore strong), but the field was prechosen by the program
- WGAI
    + capable of 'learning' but to limited degrees - weak (subhuman)
- SGAI
    + like a human. can learn any task well. not preprogrammed to perform well in tasks.
- ASI
    + superhuman. recursive self improvement.

# What makes an artificial system intelligent
- intelligent agent
    + anyn system that perceives environment and takes actions that maximise success of achieving goals
- faculties
    + learning
    + problem solving


# The goals of AI research
- language processing/ understanding
- reasoning
- knowledge representation
- planning
- machine learning
- perception
- interact with physical world
- general intelligence

# Tools for learning
- ANNs
- statistical methods/ probability
- mathematical optimisation

# Artificial Neural networks
    The term NN is usually used to mean NN in this context
    ANNs originally designed to behave like human brain, but now only used in specific tasks.
    when someone uses an ANN they want to create a system which can automatically make conclusions about a given input set. the ANN is a model which can gain ability to make conclusions about input data by learning from example data and the desired conclusions made about each of the example data points.
- set of algorithms inspired by biological neural networks in brain.
- these systems mathematically enable the system to learn from inputs to produce outputs
- the inputs to an ANN node are real numbers
- each node performs some kind of function (non linear function) based on its inputs to create an output
- the connections between nodes have a weight that can be adjuusted (changing the strength of the input signal)
- nodes are organised in layers, each which may perform different transformations on teh inputs.
- Types of ANNs
    + recurrent neural networks
        *  
    + feedforward NNs
        * the connections between nodes do not form a cycle.

# Learning
- deep learning
- suypervised learning
    + labelled input data, learns from this and makes conclusions from parts of the data statistically linked to the label
- unsupervised learning
    + statistical grouping of features. eg autoencoder, matrix factorization, clustering, independent component analysis.
- semisupervised learning
    + start with unsupervised leanring, then this model is used to improve an existing model which has been trained from labelled data.
- feature learning
    + allows system to automaticaally discover representations needed for feature detection or clasisfication from raw data.
    + either supervised/ unsupervised

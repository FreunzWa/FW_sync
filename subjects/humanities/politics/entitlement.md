###### Entitlement

Increasing entitlement in new generations

Immoral to say how wealth is to be distributed as increased taxes on the wealthy constitute taking money away from people. Why cant we work out a solution whereby we decrease poverty an increase incomes - why is socialist theory wrong here. I do agree that there should be a progressive taxation system - where tax is levied according to means. i believe that even in small amounts this will be able to support a modest social welfare system to decrease rate sof poverty, homelessness, crime.

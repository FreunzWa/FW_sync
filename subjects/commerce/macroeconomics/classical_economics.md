- economic policy in politics are usually espoused by pragmatic liberals, who advocate for market freedom but recognise that at times it is necessary for the government/ overarching regulation to intervene to ensure the common good. 
- some recognise that CE does not serve the common good, as a result govt regulation is often welcomed to impose tax for social welfare.

- advocates free trade
- did not believe in the existence of economic cycles, blaming any fluctuations on external factors (eg wars)

###### Electricity
    electric force is a long range contact free funddamaental force that varies in magnitude with the inverse square law (Coulomb's law)
    cohesion @electrostatic attraciton between partial charges on a dipole w/ hydrogen bonds == strong cohesive force == surface tension (large for water @hydrogen bonds are)
[Faraday's method; simplying some electric systems problems by using an electric field]

# Electric charge and force
[point charge; a charged particle of negligible size]
[bohr radius; the separation distannce betwween 2 particels based on atomic radius]
[test charge; uised for purposes of drawing electric field lines for standardising - always positive unit charge, a single proton]
[probe charge; the mobile charge of interest in a problem]
- electric charge an intrinsic property of particles as is mass. two types of charge exist, designated pos annd nefative. 
- electric neutrality of matter @atoms compriseed of equal positive and negative charge @electrons and protonns. 

# Eelctric force
- electric force related @by electric charge, @stronger magnitude electric charge == stronger force, but force dimishes proportional to the square of the distance.
- F = |q||q|/r^2 * proportionality factor fo the permittivity of vaccuum. expresses the force that charge 1 exerts on charge 2.
- charge is quantized @the elementary charge is givenn by teh smallest amount of charge possible of an electron (1.6x10^-19)

# Newtons laws and charged objects
- considered just like other forces so that a point charge will be in static equilibrium @all of the forces acting oppose == net force of 0. application fo coulombs law, often calculate distannces or charges in a system. 
- Faradays approach: solves complexity of having many poitn charges in a system by just considering them all to have a nent effect: an electriic field. must assume so that the point charges do not move reealitve  == stationary electric field (electrostatics) the electric field is a vector field @a force field, with the force at each point being given by Coulomb's law

# Electric field
[charge density; p=Q/V, Q is the sum of all charges, V is the voluem of the system. C/m^3. this is used for systems that have free pointc rages which cannot move but distributed in 3 dimensions]
- allows calculation of the effect of an arrangement of charges at any opsition, without having to actually have the probe particle at that positoin
- Fel = qE (the units for E the electric field are N/C). the E is calculated from Coulomb's equation essentially without the second charge in teh eequation. the r term becomes the distance away from teh point charge where we are claculating the strenght of thfe electric field.
- electric field of stationary point charge
    + electric field vector field pointed away from a positive charge and towards a negative charge.
- electric field of a dipole (two opposite charges of equal magnitude separated by a distance to generate an electric field.)
    + sum of two components of dipole, thus calculate the Electric field due to eeach element of hte dipole independently and then calculate the net Electrirc field.
    + the electric field of a dipole drops proportionally to 1/r^3, more rapidly than the electric field of a single charge. (1/r^2 in that case)
- electric field of charged parallel plates
    + mathematically simple electric fieeld. the surface charge density is simliar to charge density but is C/m^2.
    + eg of the charge density on either side o the neuronal membrane.
    + the electric field betwween charge plates is independennt of positionn, proportional to the surface charge deensity, inveerse prop to the permittivity constnat.

# Electric dipole momennt
- product of chrage and distance defines the electric dipole moment. it is a measurement of hte polarity of a chemical bond within a molecule @separation fo charges.
    + mu = qd

# Electric potential
    Electricl potential energy eg @linear opposite charged plate system. Thus a function fot eh strength fo teh electric field @for a point charge system the potential energy will be related by proportin factor 1/r^2
    in contrast to eh electric field, the electric potential is a scalar field 
    cannot measure electric rfields direclty, inteased use the poetnetial difference
[Gibbs Free energy; free enthalpy - used to calculate hte maximum reversbielt work that may eb perforemed by a thermodynamic system @isothermal, isobaric ]
[potential difference of 70mV across the axon cell membrane, 6nm apart]
[dielectric; an electircla insulator that can be polarized by an applied electrical field]
[water dielectric constant; so large @dipole moment of water == interact with close charged plate much more effectively== requires even more activation energy for a particle to travel to other plate.]
- electric energy
    + total energy fo the system now inncludes gravitaitonal , kinetic and also electric potential energy.
    + electric potential energy very simliar to GPE for an opposite chargede plate system due to teh linear nature of the forces at play. for a more complex arrangemnent the dot product of vector sis used.
    + Volts ;  meaasuremenet for eleectric potenntial (iimportantly NOT electrical potential energy!), units are J/C thus gives the magnitude of energy exerted by a given Electric field per colouumb of charge of a givenm charged particle int eh system
- only potential differences matter for discussing real phyusical phenomena. like radius of planet doesnt change how we perceive world, only local topography. 
- V (volt) denotes Electric potential, however voltage is actually referring to the potential differencce between two points iin space. thus volt and voltage are different concepts. 
- equipotential lines - lines of equal potential and thus equal electrical potential energy for a given point charge. 
- capacitors: eg axon same as two parallel conducting plates separated by 6nm space. surface charge density equal and opposite to teh inside. capacitor plates separated by an insulator to assume that allow the buildup of postive and negative charge. 
    + 3 quantities characterise a capacitor:
        * surface charge density; sigma
        * capacitance: C
        * dieletric constant; K
    + the potential difference across a capacitor is proportional linearly to the chcarge on the plates. the proportionality factor is the capacitance C in Farads (C/V), so how many coloumbs of charge u need per potential difference increase. 
    + The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor depends only on geometric properties. proportional to area of plates and permittivity of the vaccuum and inverse prop to the width o the gap between teh paltes.
    + permittivity of vaccum: measure of the ability of charge to reach through vacccuum to affect charge on other side.
    + change permittivity by replacing vaccum with material between the plates. the material is to insulate -- a dielectric material. we alter the permititivty of vaccuum with the dielectric constant K
        * K * epsilon 0. K has no units andn simply relates different materials in terms of their electrical permittivity. 
    + eg with a capacitor with the vaccuum replaced by pure water will have a capacitance 78.5 times higher as water dielectric constant is 78.5. however this means that the potential difference across the plates drops by the same value @the charge on one plate has less of an effect on teh other side.
    + capacitors store EPE, imagine starting from uncharged plates and moving particles against electrical field gradient == higher energy state. 

# Flow of charge
    @applied electricla potential difference == flow of charge proportional to density of mobile point charges, number of elementary charges carried @each particle, drift velocity of particels, cross sectional area of the conductor. 
    Resistance @Ohm's law
- flow of charge is electrical current, eg @metal is established @moving electrons in same direction @externally applied electrical force. the force will cause an acceleration of each electron according to N2. 
- electric current: defined as amount of charge transferred through cross sectional area of conductor per time unit.
    + I = dQ/ dt (C/s), given the unit A. charge passing a certain point per second, eg the flow of electrons.
- always assume that the positive point charges are the mobile charges, and the flow of positive charge is the direction of the ccurrent. however the elctrons flow in the opposite direction ot teh current. some conductors will haev positive charge flowing, movmenet of protons. this is called conventional current, the flow of positive charge.
- motion of point charges @v = dx/ dt. vd is the drift velocity. move @average speed, despite constant acceleration, the motion of a single point particel
- current density: J = I/A = n*e*drift velocity (A/m^2)
    + n is the conductivity of hte material, a materials constant. 
    + e is the elementary charge
    + J is not a mateirals constant as the drift velocity is dependent on the applied electrical field. \
- permittivity
    + measure of capacitiance encountered when forming an electric field in a particular medium. describes amount of charge neededd to generatee 1 unit of electric fluix iin a given medium. meaasure of te materials abbility to store an eleectric field in the polarisation of the medium.
    + F/m 
    + vaccuum permittivity is the lowest possible, and is refeerrede to as the eleectric constant.
    + relative permititivty is the dielectric conmstant, that is relative to vaccuum permititivty.
    + vaccuum and air permittivity very similar.
- dieletric strength
    + maximum electric field that hte m aterial can withstand under ideal conditions wihout breakin g down == failure of insulating properties.
    + there is also a minimum electric field applied that causes deterioration of the dieelectric properties.
    + intrinsic property of the material, configuarion nof the material. avalanche breakdown @electrons are freed

# Resistance to flow
- Ohm's law: E = pJ 
    + reseistivity is the proportionality factor between teh magnitude of the elctric field and the current density, which si the charge flow rate. dependent on the physical and geometric features of teh conductor.
- ohms law does not apply to semiconductors or when teh electric field strength gets very strong.
- thus ohms law relates the Volts to Ampere, in that for a given strenght fo electric field a certain current will be produced based on the properties of the conductors
- when a material follows ohms law it is said to behave ohmically.

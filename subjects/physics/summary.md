[s; displacement denote @comes from the latin spatium, curvy path]
[isaac newton; 1642-1727]
[frame of reference; abstract coordinate system and the set of physical refernece poitn that uniquely fix the coordinatee system]

# Glossary
[kinematics; basic mathematical equations that describe basic motion of objects with regards to time]
[dynamics; ]
[classical mechanics; aka classical physics model to describe the motion of macroscopic objects expect those whose mass is too large or quantum, or whose speed is too close to light speed]
[quantum mechanics; aka quantum physics, quantum physics, quantutm theory, wave mehcanical model, matrix mechanics. describes forces and interactions of the smallest scalees of energy levels of the order of atoms and subatomic partyicles]
[the 4 non-contact forces; gravity, electromagnetism, strong and weak nuclear force]
[statics; study of forces in equilbirium without consideration of changes over time]
[dynamics; the factors that cause motion - i.e. the concept of a force. time is an important component. the key factors here are force, mass and acceleration - and the mathematical models of these physical phenomena]

# Physical model
- simplification fo teh complexities of the physical world into an equation to make predictions based on important pareaameter
- some consider physics to be science of what can be ingnored
- simple models more likely to be correct than complex models
- occam's razor: entitiees must not be multiplied beyond necessity - the model with the feweestt asusmptions is teh best model.

# Classical mechanics "Newtonian mechanics"
- motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to machinery parts and celestial objects eg planets, stars etc. can be used detemrinistically and reversibly to predict th epositon and motinof objects
- first desccribed @newtonian mechanics who described the emathematicla methods invented to describe the motion of bodies unde rhte influcen of a systme of forces.
- produce very accurate results when studying large objects for speeds not approaching pseed of light. when objects are smaller need quantum mechanics to describe them, or when light speed is studied require special relativitiy.
- @objects that are extremely massive == general relativity is needed.

# Conversion of values
- 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h 

# Significant figures 
- state uncertainty about a quantity through sig figs; should match the lower specificity of the two numbers so that always decreasing number of significant figures as this is as precise as can be
- trailing zeroes are significant if quoted, however trailing zeroes are not significant if there is no decimal place:
    + 300. is 3 sig figs
    + 300 is 1 sig fig (trailing zeroes not sig)
- for addition and subtraction, the result has the same precisioin as teh leeast precise numberu used in the calculation - the number of decimal places that the number is precise to

# Scienfitic notation 

# Estimation notation
- ~ means order of magnitude of difference in estimation

# Quantities
- either a vector or scalar
    + scalar: quantities that are fully describied by the magnitude alone, that is it has no other chracteristics. the element can then be used to define a vector space.
    + vecttors/ tensors: quantities that are fully described by both magnitude and direction or more numbers to fully describe the object
- vector notation
    + letter with an arrow over the top because bold face is not practical as it is used in printed publication
- vector addition
    + tip to tail addition so that both scalar components are taken into account for the addition
- proportional quantities
    + if related by equation of the form: y = C*x
    + C is the proportionality constant
- quadratic relationship
    + two quantities are said to be in quadratic relationship if y is proportional to the squarre of x


# Modelling biological systems
- bones: use the rigid object model as extended objects so that rotational forces (torques) and translational forces can both be applied.

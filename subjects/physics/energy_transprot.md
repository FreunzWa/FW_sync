# Energy and matter transport
[diffusion; stochastic process of molecules moving from high to low concentration regions eg o2 in the lungs, solutes in the kidneys]

# Membranes
- separatae two systems, @semipermeable == allows exchange of heat/ matter if the two systems differ @parameter. 
- diffusion prop to surface area and iinv prop to thickness. different constants for movemnet of matter/ heat etc.
- modelled by the physical meembrane, a uniform barrier with key factors the chemical composition and width. 
    + can either use a zero width membrane to neglect the thickness factor on transport. 

# Heat conduction
- Fouriers law: describes thermodynamics of heat transfer between 2 systems separated by an interface
- depends on the material of the interface's conductivity, eeg silver is highly thermally conductive, whereas air is a good insulator

# Heat loss @human body
- fouriers law, given by surface area of the body and thickness of skin
- often given metabolic rate to find the net loss of heat

# Diffusion
- fick's law
- dependent on temperature, diffusion occurs faster @higher temperature @greater proportion fo particles have sufficient energy to enter the membrane (which is a state f higher potential energy)
- Arrheneius law and Arrhenius polt.
- length of diffusion:
    + Einstein, average length a diffusing particles travels during a time period t. 
    + specificees that a particle need not necessariily move in one direction, ubt could jnump back to the intiial site.

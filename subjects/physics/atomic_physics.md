###### Atomic physics
[nuclear force; fundamental contact free force. strong over very small distances on teh scale of an atomic nucleus. at these distances it overpowers the electric force. acts between all atomic particles - protons and neutrons to old them together]


# Radioactive decay
    radioactive nucleus is a stochastic process, cannot be predicted and occurs independently of others. 
- nuclide will eb stable @if a particular raddioactive process would produce masses that total greater mass than the original particle.
- neutrino - produced during beta decay, which usually pass through the entire planet wwithout any interaction
- mass energy converted into kinetic energy of the emitted particle.
- Q-value of nuclear decay is the total energy released in tehe process, calculated from teh mass difference of the particle using e=mc2
- six decay mechanisms
    + Gamma decay:
        * produces an isomeric transition by emitting a gamma ray
        * in imaging 99m Tc (m stands for metastable, meaning it has an excited nucleus state)
    + Beta decay and release of electron
        * emission of a neutrino (non charged almost massless particle) and an electron
        * cannot use the beta particle for imaging @cannot leave teh tissue and reach a detecto, may be used in petri dish experiementes.
        * eg 32 phosphorus --> 32 Sulfurus @emission of electron and neutrino
        * antineutrino have opposite lepton number to neutrinos, as both are electromagnetically neutral
    + Beta decay and release of positron
    + Alpha decay
        * emission of a helium nucleus, 2 neutrons and 2 protons
- Decay constant
    + define A = -dN/ dt 
    + A is the activity, the number of decays per time
    + 1 Bq (becquerel - decay/s)
    + the decay rate/ activity is proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei in teh saample - which is written as A = lambda * N (where lambda is teh proportionality factor - the decay constant)
    + yields N(t) = N0*e*-(lambda * t)
- Half life
    + represents time taken for 50% of the mass of the radioactive substance to decay


RBE
- ratio of biological effectiveness of one type of ionizine radiation relative to another, given same amount fo absorbed energy.



# Radiation dose
- dose is the amount of energy/ ionisation deposited in a gigven amount of material. dose rate is amount of energy deposited per time unit per amount of material

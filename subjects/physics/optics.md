###### Optics
    physics of light, geometric concerned with phenomena that can be modelleed with light waves. ray model assumed,to travel in stragiht lines until it reaches an interafce
    3 models to describe light: the ray modell, the wwave model, corpuscle model (aka particle)
    1. refraction
    2. reflection
[mirror equation]
[ray model; assumes that light moves along straight lines while travelling within a single medium. may change dir @interface change]
[reflection; angles equal]
[lens; a combination of 2 spherical interface]
[hyperopia/ myopia]
[cornea; modelled as a single transparent circular interface]
[magnification, totla angular mangnification]
[dual model theory; that light has both p[article and wave like properties] - particle theory was reborn @einstein to explain teh photoelectric effect]


# Reflection
[real image; light actually reaches the image]
[virtual image; light does not reach teh image which is seen. basically when it looks like the object is somewhere other than where it actually is]
[spherical aberration - in which the mirror in nquesetion has no focal pint]
[aperture; device to confirne the spread of incoming light]
- law reflection:   
    + states that the incoming angle is equal tot eh exit angle. (the angle made with the nnoirmal direction fo teh mirror)
    + virtual image same d from teh mirror
- other mirrors (not flat)
    + parabolic mirror 
    + spherical mirror (either concave or convex)
        * trhe centre of curvature is used to describe the opitcal axis
        * Radius of curvature (R) - the length VC
        * F (focal point)
        * f (distance ffrom teh mirror surface to the focal point) - the length VF
        * I (the location at which teh resultant image is forced, the light rays focussing)
        * q (horizontal distance between image and the mirror)
            - q is negative == image is behind the mirror == virtual image
        * h (vertiucl distance from the optical axis)
        * p (object distance)
            - if p is negative, then object is bhind the image == virtual object
- focal point
    + f = R/ 2 (radius of curvature) at the point of V (where the ootical axis intersects with the mirro)
- mirror equation
    + 1/f = 1/p + 1/q
    + relates teh focal lenght of the mirror with teh object and image distrances
- magnificiation 
    + can be done by spherical mirrors
    + M = -q/p

# Refraction
- pass through trasnparent media
- intensity of light decreases @pass through medium (the opitcal depth) -- imagine looking to the bottom fo a deep lake, jupiter (the gases are transparent for short disretances)
- Snell's law
    + angle of entry/angle of exit = n (the index of refraction)
        * n1 sin a1 = n2 sin (a2) the law of refraction
    + gas values have values fvery close tto vaccum (1.0 - where the angles are the same)
    + water has an n of 1.33
- total reflection @very high refractive index == approaches normal value
- refractive power:
    + refractive power of a given interface is given by difference in indices of refraction of the materials divided by teh radius of cruvature.

# Eye
- near point
    + the point nearest the eye that at which an object can be placed and still have a sharp image. normally 25 cm. @hyperopic ==  near point further away @lens cannnot contract as wmuch
    + myopia when the far point is less far away. the near point may be closer than normal.
    + hyperopia is when incomplete reshaping of hte refractive power of the lens whne the fibres are relaxed. 
- dioptre   
    + unit of measurement of optical power of lens or curved mirror, the reciprocal of the focal length
    + diopters are additive
    + cornea has a fixed power of 40
    + cornea adds betwen 18 and 32 depending.
    + negative dioptre means that it is a converging lens.

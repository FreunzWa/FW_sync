###### Stock valuation
    stock valuation, many different approaches, which may vary based on the sector.

# Absolution valuatyion
- aims to find intrinsic/ true value of a given investment based on fundamentals. (eg cash flow, dividends, growth rate)
    + eg dividend discount model
    + discounted cash flow model
    + residual income model
    + asset based model

# Relative valuation
- compare company in question to other similar companies. 
- eg PE comparison between other companies
- usually easier to use as a starting point.

###### Stock valuation methods
    dividend stock valuation methods make the claim that a company's value is equal to teh sum of its discounted future cash flows.


# Dividend discount model (DDM)
    very old conservative method for valuing stocks, it makes many assumptions about the companies future interest rates and past performance.
- theory is that the value of company to shareholders is based on dividend payments, nothing else. (i would argue capital gains is important here as well for shareholders -- they argue this is speculation that it will go up)
- multi stage dividend discount model
    + dividends are unsteady. these models take into account varying growth rates (eg a period of 7%, period of 5% and so on.) these models must determine when dividend will grow by certain amount etc.
- DOES the company pay a dividend?
- BEST to use well established blue chip companies in well developed industries.
- IDEA: 
    + could make a dividend predictability measure that takes into account the dividedns payout ratio and the likelihood of that happening based on historical fundamental data. n 
- Present Absolute Value = Future Value/ (1+IR)

# Discounted cash flow model
- DCF model usess the discounted future cash flows to value the business
- can be used equally for stocks that pay dividends and those that dont, or those that pay dividedns irregularly.\
- typicall y only usable for large blue chip blue companies. early companies will be very unreiable in grwoth rate of cash flow @capex
- Two Stage DCF model
    + free cash flows forecasted for 5-10 years, and a TV is calculated; thus must use a company with relatively reliable growth rate.

# Comparables model
- doesnt attempt to find absolute value for a stock/ company
- compares stock price multiples with other stocsk or relative to a given benchmark to find the one that is valued the best.
- popular options include:  
    + price to book value (P/B)
    + prie to sales PS
    + price to cash flow PCF

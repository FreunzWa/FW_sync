# Dividends
    portion of earnings (profits of the company) paid to shareholder from company. chosen @company board of directors. the rest of profits are retained earnings == reinvested into the company.
    many large established companies will pay dividends, other growth companies will simply reinvest all of the earnings.
    dividends given out by companies because the purpose of company is gto generate wealth for stakeholders - and this is a good way of doing so in additional the normal growth expectations.

# Decision of dividend amount
- even @no net profits, some companies still pay dividends to maintain good track record.

# Payment timing
- usu either annually, quarterly, bi-annual or monthly. quarterly is the most common.

# special dividend
- non recurring additional dividend payment, sometimes in addition to normal dividend or at a different time.

# Dividend paying instruments
- large established companies
- some funds, eg ETFs will also pay dividends. (this is based on the income of teh fund not necessarily the companies - but should ultimately reflect the companies' profits.)
- usu high growth companies or tech companies/ startups do not offer dividedns.
- companies such as utilities/ staples etc. often pay larger dividdedns.

# Dividend dates
- announcement date:
    + announced @company on this date.
    + shareholders must approve the dividend
- ex-dividend date 'ex-date''
    + if you hold shares BEFORE this date you are eligible for dividend receipt. (the dividend stocks are no longer dividend stocks- they are 'ex' dividend stocks)
- record date
    + cut off date where the company determines who ges the dividedn
- payment date
    + pyament issued on this date - credited to investors account.

# Dividends and stock price
- stock price increased from announcement date, and decreased on the ex-dividend date where the stock no longer will pay a dividend for that installment.
- eg 60$ per share company - board declares 2$ dividend == jumps to 62$ per share. after ex=date falls to 60$
- @regular schedule of dividend payments disrupted or decreases == shareholders may think the company is in a difficult position == may cause the stock price to significantly decrease.

# Dividend-based income and taxation
- in australia, Aus residents are taxed through imputation:
    + if a company pays shareholder with dividends, they can be franked.
    + dividends can be fully franked or patially franked: the dgree to which the dividend has been franked will determine the amount of payment necessary.


# Dividend analytics:
- dividend yield
    + ratio of annual dividend to share price 
    + looks very high @stock falling quicikly.
- payout ratio
    + percentage of companies earnings that are used to finance dividends. the rest is retained earnings for reinvestments.
    + can even be higher than 100% - means that company is paying out more than it is actually earning.

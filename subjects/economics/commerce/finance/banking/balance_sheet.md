###### Balance sheets

# Terms
- debt: others peoples money that you are using
- equity: difference between value of assets and value of liabilities of something owned. amount of money risked. 
- savings: reserves
- liabilities: something that you own to someone else.
- leverage = assets/ equity (amount of money risked, which may be a combination of your own cash and debt/ liabilities). it can represent your interest in a given asset.
- non recourse vs. recourse loan (the debtor can take legal action and repossess as much as possible in order to get loan value back)

# structure
- to answer the following questions
    + "How much assets do I have?" - look at the left side
    + "How did I acquire those assets" - look at the right side.
- the left and the right side must match - it is the accounting equation

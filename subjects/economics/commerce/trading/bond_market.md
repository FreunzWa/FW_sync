###### Bonds

# Basics
- bonds are contractural agreements between two parties, that constitute a loan from one party to the other. The agreement is that the face value of the loan will be paid at an agreed date after the bond is written. To compensate for opportunity cost, the lendee must pay the interest rate on the money. Thus they are fixed income to the bond holder. Bonds are written by corporations and governments to finance operations by raising money.


- when you buy bond, you are selling debt to the other party. they can use this debt to finance/ leverage production. 
- the principal/ par value is paid back in full @reach maturation. 
- the bond has a fixed interest rate, and to compensate you for lending the money, this interest rate is paid back to the buyer of the bond. 


# Types of bond
- inflation linked bonds
- bonds
    + however this bond is vulnerable @especially if long term does not provide protection against inflation. only guarantees a positive nominal return, not a positive real return. thus it would not be a smart investment unless the discount rate is high (enough to hedge against inflation)

# Bond prices and interest rates (inverse relationship)
- because bond discount rates are fixed, when there is an increase in interest rates generally, bond prices will fall to match the lost opportunity cost - the bond becomes less valuable
- if interest rates continue to climb, fewer bonds will be issued @people scared of continuing interest rate increase.

###### Capitalism 4.0

# Main ideas

# What is capitalism
- embodies and encourages two essential human attributes: competitive spirit (ambition) and desire for gratificiation (described pejoravtively as greed)

# The idea of different forms of capitalism
- that there are different forms of capitalism during history, since the emergence of free markets in 1815 with the fall of napoleon. capitalism has manifest itself differently, largely about the degree of government control on the economy.
- 1815-WWI: laissez-faire economics
    + Based on Adam Smith's 'The wealth of nations'
    + the government and economic systems are totally separate. 
- 1930-1970: emergence of Keysenian economics, new deal and very strong government control over the economy
    + Capitalism 2. A reinvented capitalism was needed after the threats from fascism, communism after the great depression and the contradictiojns of capitalism saw its downfall. Its intellectual basis is Keyne's General theory in 1936. 
    + Keynesian golden era from 1946-1969. ended with inflationary funding of the vietnam war. great inflation with stagflation. gold backing stopped in 1971.
    + believed that keynes policies caused own downfall by attempting to maintain full employment, caused an inflationary spiral
- 1970: emergence of Thatcher and Reagan, which saw decreased cgovernment control and frther infatuation with market fundamentalism encouraged by the works of Ayn Rand, a market fundamentalist. this approach caused the GFC, and would have been worse had it not been for government intervention.
    + monetarist revolution.
- 2007 onwards: the new form of capitalism, now it is inarguable that pure market fundamentalism cannot be sustained. it must be accepted that both forms: pure laissez faire and strong governemnt regulation both have flaws. pragmatism must be taken in the approach to market regulation. 

# The theory of the boom and bust cycle
- Austrian theory
    + tha ta period of low intererst rates to stimulate consumer spending and econmimc growht causes credit expansion, and eventually som eof hte money is spent on projects which do not produce a lot of value, and thus the economy becomes inefficient and recession sets in. this purges inefficient actors from the economy, allowing the economy to return to its boom period. 
- mimsky moment
    + long period of economic stability causes investors to become over confident and take more risks, banks find new ways of giving loans to riskier loan buyers, they become very leveraged. it starts when borrowers have debt problems, banks attempt to seize the collateral which isnt worth as much, they cannot sell it so they become insolvent, people withdraw their money as the banks become less credible
- soros theory of reflexivity
- behavioural economics
    + irrational exuberance and irrational despondency (anchoring syndrome and herd mentality) 
- income distribution   
    + @increasing inequality in income distribution, where the poorer become poorer and have to rely on debt to maintain their standard of living == banks can make more money by continuously giving loans to the poor, and actually have to do this otherwise the economy will stagnate == credit expansion becomes unsustainable 

# On the form that capitalism 4.0 will take
- it will be an adaptive mixed economy 
- 

# On the inefficiencies of a purely capital-fundamentalist market
- laiisez faire systems do not have te capacity to solve urgent social problems,such as climate change. this can only be done by changing the economic environment through government regulation. 

# Why a democratic version of capitalism with government regulation inherent is far more effective
- capitalism doesnt break; it bends. that with the principles of democracy existential threats to capitalism can be defused as capitalism adapts by instituting pragmatic government regulaiton. 

# Why over-zealotry in bureaucracy as a means of controlling the economy is unfounded and can lead to disaster
- that the economy and world are often too complex for simple policies to work. 
- economists that claim to divine the future trajectory of the economy are to be degraded as the one thing that is certain in economics is that nothing is certain 

# On the collapse of Captialism 3.0, the GFC
- the US hosuing market boom was actually very modest in comparison to the boom experienced in overseas countries. 
- Lehman collapse
    + Lehman collpase on Sept 15 was not especially large for bank collapse in historical standards. However it was that its collapse allowed for a total loss of confidencei nt eh banking system == financial panic. 1. Lehman was not bailed out. 2. Safeguards for other banks were not installed until a month too late.
- mark to market
    + banks forced to report all losses == furthered financial panic. this was ended in 2009 and bank stocks recovered a week later.
- GSE 'rescue'/ seizure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
- what stopped full scale economic destruction
    + governmetn intervention, printing of money to support the banks to give guarantees to all depositors that they would not lose any money given bank insolvency. this stopped bank runs and flight of credit to other countries where those guarantees had been made.

# Capitalism 4.0
- economic policy in 4.0
    + 


# Further reading
- 'New normal' - this is a deeply negative view about how economy will perform in the forseeable future post-GFC. 
- Micawber principle - "something will turn up", that is, a problem effectively postponed for long enough is a problem solved. - a justification for optimism.
- Greenspan
- Adam Smith - "invisible hand" - central to laissez faire capitalism. that a focus on benefitting one self is to the benefit of all, the common good. people have to be creative to produce wealth, and their creativity will benefit all.

    + forex rate, price decreases markedly. means that there is less offshore investment. cant be good for the economy. importing goods will be more expensive, which is good for american small businesses. exporting goods profitable. 
    + rapid inflation would ensue
- a currency can fall only if another currency rises
    + this is why the US dollar would not freefall after the GFC as no other eocnomy could accommodate all that money
- debt 100% of GDP is about the maximum that seems to be sustainable.

# Further questions
- why is out of control inflation bad for economy
    + this is my understanding:
        * eg. expansion of monetary supply == more money in circulation == people can afford to pay more for GS == GS prices increase == businesses can afford to pay workers more == wages increase == new equilibrium is established. at this new equilibrium each unit of currency is worth less, but no one has actually lost money relative to what it can buy. so people can just carry around new notes with 100000000 written on it. 
            - having to print new notes is bad. 
            - could be lag in paying workers more, but this would mean that prices wouldnt go higher, and 
- does expansion of money supply change interest rates
    + more money in banks == money is cheaper to borrow == interest rates are lower == more investment/ spending/ AD increases. people are less likely to want to save too much money @1. interest rates are low 2. there is inflation and so money today will be worth less tomorrow. 
- collapse of the dollar
    + causes inflation, how? requires interest rate increase == bond market panics. less investment. no govt borrowing, no mortgages == economic stagnation.

- how do interest rates affect overseas investment

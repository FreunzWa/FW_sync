- photolysis
    + @light == decomposition of a molecule
- tropopause
    + boundary between earth troposphere and stratosphere.
- pyrolysis
    + decomposition of molecules @high temperatures
- chromphore
    + an atom/ group whose presence is responsible for hte colour of a compound
- photoautotroph 
    + organism that can derive own energy @light
- Arrhenius rate
    + formulea to calculate the speed of a chemical reaction based on teh temperature relative to absolute 0
- jeans escape
    + an atmospheric escape mechanism @kinetic energy, favouring lighter molecules to escape
- a priori
    + relating to or denoting reasoning or knowledge which proceeds from theoretical deduction rather than from observation or experience.
- eddy diffusion    
    + any diffusion process by which substances mixed in teh atmosphere @eddy motion. mixing caused @eddies.
- Kolmogorov scales
    + smallest scales in turbulent flow
- Turublent flow
    + fluid motion characterized @chatoci changes in pressure and flow velocity, contrasting with laminar flow (parallel motion of fluid layers)
- adabiatic
    + a process occuring with no transfer or heat or mass between the sytem and its surroundsigs. only transfers energy to its surroundings @work. (eg @vertical flow of air in the atmosphere @it changes in temoerature causing it to expand.)    
- photic zone
    + layer of the ocean closest ot he surface that receives enough light for photosynthesis to occur
- aphotic zone
    + illuminated poorly layer of the ocean  == rates of respiration exceed energy production of photosynthesis
- photic zone
- hadal zone
    + named @hades, the deepest region of the ocean lying @oceanic trenches from 6-11km under the surface.
    + most hadal habitat in the pacific ocean - challenger deep is the deepest point
- gyradius  
    + root mean square of the distance of the objects parts from the objects axis of gyration
- leading hemisphere: @tidally lcoked the sde of a satellite that faces the object taht it is orbiting.
- meteortic impact gardening (lunar gardening): process @impact events == stirring of crusts on bodies w/ no atmospheres. no atmosphere results in fine impact debris 'regolith' gathering on the surface. subsequent impacts @micrometeorties stir the soil. 
- azimuthal quantum number
    + quantum number for an atomic orbital that determines its orbital angular momentum, describing the shape of ists orbital. second set of QN that describe the unique state of an electron. (suchg as magnetic, spin, principal QNs)

- photolysis
    + @light == decomposition of a molecule
- tropopause
    + boundary between earth troposphere and stratosphere.
- pyrolysis
    + decomposition of molecules @high temperatures
- chromphore
    + an atom/ group whose presence is responsible for hte colour of a compound
- photoautotroph 
    + organism that can derive own energy @light
- Arrhenius rate
    + formulea to calculate the speed of a chemical reaction based on teh temperature relative to absolute 0
- jeans escape
    + an atmospheric escape mechanism @kinetic energy, favouring lighter molecules to escape
- a priori
    + relating to or denoting reasoning or knowledge which proceeds from theoretical deduction rather than from observation or experience.
- eddy diffusion    
    + any diffusion process by which substances mixed in teh atmosphere @eddy motion. mixing caused @eddies.
- Kolmogorov scales
    + smallest scales in turbulent flow
- Turublent flow
    + fluid motion characterized @chatoci changes in pressure and flow velocity, contrasting with laminar flow (parallel motion of fluid layers)
- adabiatic
    + a process occuring with no transfer or heat or mass between the sytem and its surroundsigs. only transfers energy to its surroundings @work. (eg @vertical flow of air in the atmosphere @it changes in temoerature causing it to expand.)    
- photic zone
    + layer of the ocean closest ot he surface that receives enough light for photosynthesis to occur
- aphotic zone
    + illuminated poorly layer of the ocean  == rates of respiration exceed energy production of photosynthesis
- photic zone
- hadal zone
    + named @hades, the deepest region of the ocean lying @oceanic trenches from 6-11km under the surface.
    + most hadal habitat in the pacific ocean - challenger deep is the deepest point

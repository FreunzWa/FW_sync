# Federal govt
- 3 branches
    + legislature
        * bicameral parliament (senate and house of reps)
        * bicameral @supposed to keep the other chamber in check
    + executive
        * legal effect to decisions of the govt which is lead by the prime minister and cabinet ministers
    + judiciary
        * high court of australia and other federal courts, appointed @governor general


# Australian house of reps
- the house of government
- most legislation (called bills) originate before becoming law
- now 151 seats in the HOR, each representing voters in electorate, so based on each states populations


# Australian senate
- the upper house of bicameral legislature
- intended to be a house of review
- 12 seats in each state, 2 in the territories.
- this gives the smaller population states a disproportionately larger vote "unrepresentative swill"
- very rare to get both a majority in the HOR and the senate
- many many independent parties in the senate, because of the preferential voting system
- 2016 fed election, malc turnbull changed rules for voting in the senate: now have to label more boxes above the line for future senate elections.

# Liberal party (LP)
- coalition of the autralian national party and the liberal party
- supposed to be a centre-right party, but has factions: more right leaning


# Leadership spills
- because the party is elected, not the prime minister (the prime minister is just the leader of leading party, PM can more easily change than US system
- in 2013 KR introduced laws to make more difficult leadership challenges: month long wait and 60% vote required (up from 50%)
- however lib party laws not as strong

- 92F p/w fatigue and Hb of 70, please come and review. First PRBC bag just went in.
    + assess: 
        * pt has features of fluid overload after 1 250mL bag of PRBC
        * pitting edema to mid-shin, mild bi-basal crepitations, JVP mildly elevated.
        * past history of HF
    + management:
        * can consider contacting registrar if unsure
        * increase frusemide 20->40mg and switch to IV frusemide infusion
        * fluid balance charting/ fluid restrictions if concerned
        * VBG to test Hb -> consider if the 2nd bag of PRBC is needed
- 80M 2.7K+ on the ward p/w delirium. Has past history of after
    + assess:
        * symptomatic? in AF? palpitations/ SOB/ chest pain/ pre-syncope?
        * ECG - features of hypokalemia are present (T-wave inversion on all leads) and show active non rapid AF rate 68. 
        * K+ downtrending now for 24 hours
    + management:
        * get help registrar
        * @low K+, may do repeat K+ depending on when the last bloods were taken
        * commence K+ replacement: oral K+ is probably best @can more rapidly correct and more comfortable. @<2.5 then combination oral + K+ infusion
        * repeat K+ 30 minutes after completion of the K+ infusion then reassess.
- 92F developed rash after 2nd bag of PRBC
    + STOP transfusion @possible allergic reaction
    + DRSABC to assess for severe hypersensitivity reaction (anaphylaxis)
    + maintain IV access 
    + @stable == commence cetirizine 10mg
    + can discuss with registrar/ haem whether can continue with a lower rate @still not meeting Hb targets.
- 55M with severe hypertension 190/100 please review.
    + assess:
        * symptomatic?
        * what is normal for this patient?
        * could it be a secondary HTN
        * features of end organ damage present?
            - lung: dyspnoea
            - brain: delirium/ GCS decline
            - kidney: AKI/ oliguria
            - eyes: blurred vision
            - heart: chest pain/ MI
            - vascular: intracranial bleed/ AAA burst
        * differentatite into hypertensive urgency vs. emergency @presesnce of end organ damage features which will guide management.
    + manage:
        * can give next anti-HTN dose early
        * reassess 30 minutes later/ try calm patient (sit down in quiet area)
        * address underlying reversible causes eg. pain / anxiety (eg analgesia)
        * new anti-HTN?
        * Ca2+ channel blockers or nitrogen containing emergency anti-HTN to reduce BP

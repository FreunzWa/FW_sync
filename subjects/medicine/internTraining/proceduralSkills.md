###### Procedural skills

# Suturing
    technique
    placement
    choice of needle
    choice of suture material
- types:
    + monofilament
        * used @low tension, more difficult to manipulate but usable in all places. reduced infection risk
    + braided
        * used @higher tension areas @more strength (elbows, feet, large abdomen wounds)
- anaesthetic
    + check for patient allergies
    + go all the way in, and withdraw a bit to ensure not in a blood vessel
    + local lidocaine injection @wound site
- techniques
    + simple interrupted

# Blood cultures

# IVC
- explain procedure, confirm patient, allergy status, gloves
- tourniquet (tight, only 2 fingers underneath on preferred arm)
- examine arm for potential sites (hand or cubital fossa - patient clench hand to help/ tapping can release NO == dilation of vessels)
- disinfect surface
- insert cannula whilst tethering the skin, then reduce angle to body
- observe for flashback and then advance the cannula through teh vein
- loosen the tourniquet, oclcude vein proximally and then attach the anti-reflux valve
* secure the cannula in place with appropriate dressing


# Arterial blood gas
- allen's test for ulnar artery (occlude both and release ulnar artery)
- feel pulsation
- use ABG syringe, enter @pulsation, and confirm can see pulsation of flashback

# Airway management
- signs/ features
    + cough, stridor, wheeze, lack of noises
    + use of accessory muscles, RR (first sign @deterioration)
    + oxygen saturations
- basic
    + Manoeurvres: Head tilt/ jaw thrust
    + Adjuncts: 
        * orpharyngeal airway (guedel airway)
        * Bag mask ventilation (better performed @two people)
        * nasopharyngeal airway + lubricant (6-7 mm for adults). can use suction to assist with obstruction
        * Hudson mask (15L/ min oxygen)
        
# IDC
- confirm patient, allergy status
- risks
    + pain, bleeding, false lumen creation, unable to pass catheter, infection

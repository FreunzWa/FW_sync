###### Fluid assessment
- TBW (50-60% of body weight)
    + 60% intraceullar fluid
    + 40% extracellular fluid
        * blood plasma
        * interstitial fluid
- "dehydration": loss of water without loss of sodium (hypernatremia)
- hypovolaemia is more general, independent of sodium levels
- losses
    + reduced intake 
    + increased loss (overdiuresis, diarrhoea, vomiting, burns, surgery, drains, diuretics)
    + sequestration
- hypervolaeima
    + 3 failures
        * renal failure
        * cardiac failure
        * liver failure
    + iatrogenic
        * too much fluid (review again in between bags) "bottomless bag of saline" OR @giving fluids with drugs (eg tazocin/ vancomycin)

# clinical review
- chart review
    + recent investigations, patient history, recent vitals, fluid balance and weights, current issues, medications that may be contributing
        * fluid balance: inputs and outputs (oral fluids/ intake, IV fluids, insensible losses are approx 600-900 mL, tube output, IDC)
        * weights: good @same scales and lightest clothes. good @long term.
    + HOPC
        * fluid intake/ losses (diarrhoea, nausea, do they feel thirsty -- can even ask overloaded/ dry)
        * dizziness/ LHF symptoms/ dyspnoea/ heart failure/ peripheral edema
    + Examination
        * compare w/ obs
        * hypervolaemia @heart failure (crepitations, dullness @bases, reduced breath sounds, raised JVP, edema)
        * hypovolaemia
            - hypotension is a LATE sign (@severe loss of body water)
            - tachycardia LATE
            - postural BP and postural tachycardia is more SN (wont get this from nurses chart), but less SP
            - TT, MM, cap refill, poorly perfused
        * urine (output and color)
            - UO is a good early sign
    + investigations
        * FBE (Hb/ Hct) -- dilutional effect of blood volume
        * UEC
            - @dehydrated == hypernatremia
            - hypovolaemia can be any, but important
            - urea (goes up @hypovolaemia @-=renal perfusion)
            - U:Cr ratio:
                + urea goes up, creatiine maintined @dehydration
        * lactate
            - @hypovolaemia/ shock
    + treatment
        * determine goal
        * oral fluid
        * IV fluids
        * ongoing assessment of response to therapy
- assessment
    + determine weather hypo/hyper or euvolaemic. obvious @extreme, otherwise difficult to determine

# Outside in approach
    structure is outside--in, focusing on getting supports in order for the patient first before optimising control medical conditions.
    Every point is made with a view to increasing their ability to perform their ADLs
- Environment
    + place (nursing home, own house, apartment)
- People
    + Family supports
- Equipment
    + equipment for interacting with the environment, other people to perform ADLs
- Self
    + Diet
    + Drugs
    + Disease
        * go through each disease and consider how better management of that disease could help with the presenting issue

###### Cranial nerves

# Functions
- CN1
    + smell
- CN2
    + vision
    + afferent pupillary constriction reflex to light
    + afferent accommodation
- CN3
    + eye movements: IO, SR, IR, MR (up, down, nasal movements)
    + efferent pupillary constriction reflex to light
    + efferent accommodation
- CN4
    + eye movement: SO (downward movement when eye is facing nasally)



# Anatomy

- CN1
- CN2
- CN3
- CN4
    + dorsal midbrain, decussates then exits dorsally on the contralateral side below the inferior colliculus
    + circles anteriorly, runs toward eye in subarachnoid space
    + passes between posterior cerebral artery and superior cerebellar artery
    + pierces dura under free margin of tentorium cerebelli
    + runs interiorly on lateral wall of the cavernouis sinus
    + joined by CN3,6 and V1/V2 
    + enters via the superior orbital fissue to innervate SO

# Injury/ Palsy findings

- CN1
- CN2
- CN3
- CN4
    + @nuclear injury == contralateral SO palsy (cannot move eye downward @facing nasally)
    + @nerve injury after exiting == ipsilateral SO palsy

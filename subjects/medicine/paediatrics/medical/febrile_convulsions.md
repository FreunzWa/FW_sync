###### Febrile convulsions
    usu benign
    identify source of infection
    antipyretics dont decrease further seizures
    usu occur 6months-6 years. occur in 3% of healthy children. usu assoc with sim[lpe viral infection. 
    the younger the age@febrile seizure time == ++risk of recurrence
    EEG not used



# Classification
- simple
    + fever AND ALL
        * generalised TC seizure
        * duration <10 mins
        * complete recovery @<1 hour
        * do not recur within same ilness
- complex
    + Fever and ANY
        * focal features during seizure or at onset
        * duration > 10 mins
        * incomplete recovery 1 hour
        * recurrence within same ilnness
- afebrile febrile
    + during acute infectious illness w/o fever
    + features consistent with simple seeizure

# Complications
- risk of epielpsy not increased @simple, 
    + but @fhx/ other neurodevelopmental issue/ prolonged or focal seizures or Febrile SE == increased risk

# Assessment
    revolves around determining cause of hte FC, by deteremining cause of fever -- follow the febrile child guidelines
    Look for risk factors which make simple FC unlikely
        abnormal age
        signs of CNS infection
        previous afebrile seizures

# Investigations
- No Ix required @clinically determined focus of infection
- NO NEED for EEG in complex/ simple seziures
- %CNS imaging after complex seizure

# Treatment
- usu no need for treatment, but %treat as per afebrile seizures guideline
- manage undelying cause of fever/ treat infection
- refer to local paeds@
    + cannot control seizures
    + complex seizures
    + child not return to normal mental state <1 hour
    + cllinically unwell
    + seizures recurring
- need to educate parents with febrile convulsions information / what to do @has a seezirue

# Counselling points
- realise very distressing to witness BUT
- 1 in 30 children with fever get FC
- 30% recurrence @<2 years, 50% recurrence @<1 year.
- usu only get 1 ever, but @multiple usu grow out by age of 6
- most common 6 months - 6 years
- even last 1 hour dont cause harm, even if it looks really bad, will be totally fine.
- dont cause brain damage
- no increased risk @epilepsy @simple seizurue
- usu nothing to do to prevent a seizure from happening
- caused @sudden change @body temperature
- paracetamol doesnt help prevent
- clinical
    + describe presentation of seizure (unconscious, stiff and jerking, red/blue in the face)
- What to DO
    + dont panic and stay calm
    + place child on soft surface lying on back
    + record video @show to doctor
    + time how long seizure lasts
    + dont restrain
    + dont put anything in mouth including fingers
    + dont put in bath or try to lower temp, doesnt help
    + then book to see GP to find cause of fever
    + call ambulance @first seizure or @seizure >5 minutesor very unwell. dont drive unless two people, one to look after child and drive carefuully.

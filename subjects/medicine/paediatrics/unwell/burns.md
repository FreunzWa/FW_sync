###### Burns
    thinner skin == more difficult to assess depth of burns. 
    lower thershold for TSBA for burns resus fluid at 10% versus 20% for adults.
    hypothermia is a risk @iatrogenic cooling 

# Rx
- first response
    + cooling ASAP with cool, running water for 20 minutes. DONT USE COLD WATER OR ICE
    + dont use any hydrogel burn products
    + apply plastic cling wrap after burn @helps retain heat and moisture
- pain relief
    + immediate analgesia
        * fentanyl/ morphine
    + any dressing changes will require sedation

# Assessment of involved systems
- assess for respiratory: WOB, stridor, hoarsness, black sputum, singed nasal hairs/ facial swelling
- any neck burns or oropharyngeal burns must be considered for intubation
- full thickness chest burns (may require escahrotomy)
- circulation: check pulse peripherally (esp for circumfrential limb burns could indicate compartemnt syndrome)

# Estimation of surface area=
- burn diagram to calculate the TBSA (dont include areas with erythema only)
- childs palm is 1% TBSA size

# Depth assessment
- superficial : painful, dry with minor blisters and brist cap refill
- superficial dermal: moist, reddened with blisters, brisk cap refill
- deep dermal: no pain. moist with white slough, red mottled and sluuggish cap refill
- full thickness: dry, charred, whitish, absent cap refill

# Acute rx for >10%
- early discussion with PIPER + burns unit/ tert service
- primary survey
- high flow O2 @airway burns +/- intubation after discussion
- fluids:
    + replacement/ defecits
        * 2 large bore IV/ IO through uninvolved skin
        * volume: 3-4 mls/kg * %TBSA
        * give 50% of this volume within 8 hours of injury (modify based on time of injury)
        * aim for UO 1 ml/kg/hr, titrate to this
    + maintenance as per 421
- Ix
    + %CO @concerned about inhalation injury
    + ECG @electrical burn
    + bHCG @female
    + find tetanus status on history/ documentation
- consider need for escharatomy
    + ersp @severe burns/ circumfrential burns on trunk or limbs. usu only needed hours after the burn @the eschar turns into leather non compliant and restricts breathing/ circulation

# Dressings
- superficial burns dont need dressing. @facial burn == use vaseline
- @partial thickness: low adherent dressing or crepe bandage/ tape
- @deep partial  thickness: low adherent silver dressing


# Follow up
- follow up within 3 days to assess burn depth
- @cannot determine depth OR slow healing == refer to burns unit

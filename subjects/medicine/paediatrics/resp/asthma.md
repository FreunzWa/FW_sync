###### Asthma

# Acute asthma assessment and management
    @reversible airways obstruction and bronchospasm. 
    ++@viral infection == exacerbation
    asthma more difficult to diagnose @<5 yrs, trial salbutamol. asthma more common after 5 
    Wheezing is very common @babies/ toddlers however not all develop asthma. 
    most severe episodes are triggerred @viral. interval sx usu @triggers eg exercise/ cold
    25% diagnosed @asthma at some point.
[minimal handling; @sick child deteriorates with handdlinng and distressing procedures == keep child with parennt/ carer, keep environmennt quiet. very important in severe croup and asthma. -- eg dont force a posture @children will naturally adopt posutre suits airway best.]
[IPPV; intermittent positivee pressure ventilation]
[NFA; near fatal asthma]
- medical
    + complications of treatment
        * @++salbutamol use IV/ inhaled == hypokalemia risk @drawn into cells (monitor K+). consider adding KCl @already on fluids
        * salbutamol toxicity: tachycardia, MA, lactate high
- clinical  
    + H
        * cardinals, past history and existing treatments. triggers? prev episodes and hospitalisationns/ ICU admissions. assess paretnal treamtent of acute episodes.
        * asthma symptoms at night, wake up with asthma
        * interval symptoms (eg @other triggers), how well are these controlled
        * do you have an asthma action plan
        * do you take reliever/ preventer/ use a spacer?
        * do you take prednisolone when the symptoms get worse
        * ever taken epipen
        * allergies (food/ pets/ pollen/ dustmite) and medications, ever been tested for allergies
        * IUTD?
    + E
        * ability to talk, FTT, mental status
        * wheeze intensity is not reliable. @low wheeze == could be heralding imminent respiratory collapse.
        * work of breathing /hyperinflation/ recession
        * SpO2
        * consider oral pred
    - I
        + dont need a VBG/ ABG/ CXR
        + %UEC for K+ @salb toxicity.
- diagnosis
    + children 1-5
        * combination of HE features + treatment trial successful == provisional diagnosis of asthma
    + children 6+
        * can use treatment tirla or spirometry to give an asthma diasgnosis
- differnetials
    + inhaled foreign body
- management
    + ACUTE
        + mild (normal mental state, subtle/ no increased work of breathing/ able to talk)
            * salbutamaol MDI/ spacer. give 1 dose and review in 20 minutes.
        + moderate (some mild limitation in ability to talk or poor resposne to mild treatment)
            * o2 @<90% -- dont give oxygen for just increased WOB/ wheeze
            * Salbutamol 1 dose every 20 mins for 1 hr
            * consider oral pred
        + severe (limitation of ability to talk, tachycardi9a, agitated/ distressed)
            * refer to tert/ paeds
            * oxygen @<90%
            * salbumatol @MDI/ spacer 1 dose every 20 mintues for 1 hour. review ongoing requiremnets 10-20 mins after 3rd dose. 
            * Ipratropium bromide @MDI/ spacer 1 dose every 20 minutes for max 1 hour
            * oral prednisolone @vomiting, then give IV methyllpred
            * @poor response to salbutamol/ ipratropium == give Aminophylline
            * Magnesium Sulphate 
            * consider Adrenaline, repearted @5 mins @not improving == lateral thigh 1:1000 
        + critical (child is confused/ drowsy, exhausted, unable to talk, ++RR, silent chest!)
            * PICU.
            * oxygen. 
            * nebulised salbultamol (+monitor for hypokalemia/ toxicity)
            * nebulised ipratropium 
            * methylprednisolone IV
            * aminophylline
            * MgSO4
            * ?IV salbutamol 1:1000, repeat inn 5 minutes
            * Consider Adrenaline
            * PICU respiratory support (facemask CPAP, biPAP, intubation, IPPV, ECMO? but limited evidence)'
    + LONG TERM
        * Asthma Action Plan 
        * Preventers
            - 
- discharge
    + @1hr after intiitation of treamtenn @clinically well, parents are educated, adequate oral intake, even @mild hypoxia (90-94) can still discharge @clinically well. (there are written criteria for DC)
        * MUST have written action plan (Asthma Action Plan)
        * observe inhaler and spacer technique
        * go to LMO @no improvement within 48 hours
        * all should be followed up with LMO/ paed
- doses for medications
    + salbutamol (1 dose)
        * <6 yrs old: 6 puffs MDI
        * >6 yrs old: 12 puffs MDI
    + ipratropium bromide:
        * <6 yrs; 4 puffs MDI
        * >6 yrs; 8 puffs MDI
    + oral prednisolone
        * 2 mg/kg


# Asthma Action Plan
     in easy access place
- Asthma action plan
    + will specify what to do:
        * when well (almost no symptoms)
            - what preventer to take
            - how much to take (how many puffs and how many times per day)
            - reliever (when have mild symptoms)
            - and whether to use a spacer
            - and what to avoid (eg trigger avoidance and what to do with regards to exercise)
        * when not well (needing more reliever, having more symptoms, waking up with asthma)
            - keep taking preventer (how much/ freq)
            - reliever (how much/ freq)
            - other (eg what medications)
            - whether to contact doctor
        * when unwell (severe flare up, needing reliever again <3 hours, increasing WOB, waking @night with asthma sx)
            - keep taking preventer (at dose etc)
            - keep taking reliever (at dose etc)
            - whether to take prednisolone
            - contact doctor
        * critical
            - 000, say that it is asthma emergency
            - use EpiPen
            - use reliever as often as needed
- prevention
    + avoid triggers!
    + keep eczema and hay fever under control!
- during an acute episode
    + sit child comfortable + remain calm at all times
    + shake blue reliever puffer == give 4 separate puffs + USE a space if possible. for each puff == 4 breaths. then wait 4 mins and repeat the 4 breaths. 
    + If not improved after the two lots of 4 puffs then call ambulance. 
    + While waiting, continuously repeat steps 2 and 3. 
- Ongoing
    + Preventer @needed, every day.


# Evaluating worsening asthma
- review puffer and spacer use
- query compliance to taking medications
- consider alternative diagnoses that could be worsening asthma (vocal cord dysfunction, anxiety)

# Evaluating asthma
- poorly controlled asthma
    + more than 1 reliever per week suggests possibly poorly controlled asthma, especially if not associated with exercise



### Counselling
[MDI; metered dose inhaler]

# MDI Standard Inhaler Counselling
- explain what it is 
    + this is a metered dose inhaler, used for a variety of medications. this is where medication is kept. 
- explain how to use it
    + remove the dust cap
    + shake gently
    + breathe out fully away from the inhaler
    + angle:
        * not pointed to high into top of mouth or into tongue, pointed at back of throat
    + tight seal between the lips/ teeth and the opening
    + press canister as you breathe in deeply, hold breath for 5-10 seconds after
    + repeat as required
    + put the dust cap back on
- confirm patient undestands use
- common pitfalls
    + not breathing in as pressing the canister
    + not breathing in deeply enough
    + not holding breath for longe enough
    + not shaking or waiting in between puffs

# MDI Puffer and spacer counselling
- explain importance
    + spacers are used with puffers (MDIs), reason of use is to increase amount of medications that get down to small areas
- precautions
    + must clean with warm soapy water with parts separate, allow to air dry to prevent static electricity.
- how to use
    + dust cap off the puffer
    + assessmble the puffer to match up notches
    + put the puffer at end of the spacer
    + firm seal with lips
    + deep breath in as you are pressing down on the canister
        * for children/ adolescents may use 3-4 breaths rather than one deep breath. 
    + hold breath as long as comfortable
    + if repeating dose then remove the MDI and shake it again before continuing
- get patient to demonstrate use

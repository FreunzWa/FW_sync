###### Common respiratory conditions in children
    @young == get 6-12 infx per yeaer. usu cough <3 weeks, @longer == must rule out other causes.
    asthma usu not present with cough
    URTI is the most common cause, self limtiing and does not need treatment.
[malacia; softness]
[stridor; abnormal hight pitched sound @turbulennt airflow through partially obstructed upper airway]
# Approach to wheezing child
    common pres @young, 20% infants wheeze, 40% children under 6 have at least 1 wheezing episode. 
- ddx
    + asthma
    + foreign body
    + bronchomalacia
    + congenital cardiac disease
    + congenital structrual airway abnormality
    + GERD (aspiration lung disease)

# Noisy breathing
- class
    + wheeze (high pitched, usu expiratory, lower airways)
    + stridor (upper airway, usu inspiratory)
        * vocal cord paralysis
        * obstruction of upper airway
        * Laryngomalacia
        * subglottic stenosis
        * subglottic haemangioma
        * laryngeal web, cyst, laryngocele
        * cystic hygroma
        * tracheomalacia (softness of trachea == collapses @expiration) == stridor
        * external tracheal compression (vascular ring)
    + stertor
    + ruttles
- examination
    + skin: skin lesions (eg strawberry haemangioma) == these can be within larynx == obstruction.
    + sounds
        * stridor (usu inspiratory but as it becomes severe then becomes biphasic)
        * wheeze (expiratory @occurs with collapse of airways @increase in thoracic pressure.)

# Approach to Persistent Cough
    Whooping Cough (time course and presence of cough fits)
    Viral URTI/ Common Cold (absence of concerning/ onset) -- <3 weeks cough
    Asthma
    Bronchiolitis
    Croup
    Cardiac failure
    Inhaled foreign body

- E
    + fever, FTT, clubbing, tachypnoea, wheeze, differential air entry/ crepitations
- Managmenet
    + @otherwise well with normal exam == monitor + reassurance
        * avoid exposure to cigarette smoke
        * arrange follow up with LMO in 2-3 weeks
    + @unwell chiuld with abnormal examination  
        * further investigations
        * rule out whooping cough, asthma, foreign body inhalation, sinusitis, CXR @no other obvious cause + followup with a paediatrician.

# Psychogenic cough
    usu @children/ adolescents
    develop after URTI
    non productive, harsh and barking cough
    no other feeature of illness

# Bronchiolitis
    clinical diagnosis! common in children with supportive management
    usu <2 yrs old.
    extremely common, almost 100% get bronchioltiis before age of 2 yrs.
    only 1% o childrsn with Bronchiolitis are admitted to hospital.

    affects 15% of children at some point. 

- clinical

- medical
    + rf for seevere Croup
        * pre-existing narrowing of upper airwways, prev severe croup, <6 months old. very unusual <3 months so other diagnoses must be entertained.
- prevention
    + influenza and Diptheria vaccination
- managmenet
    + treatment is supportive
    + minimal handling w/ limited examination
    + keep children with carer
    + allow child to adopt own posture

    + defer IV access
    + DC stridor free at rest AND has had 4 hours of neb adrenaline OR 30 minutes after steroid administration


# Protracted BActerial bronchitis
    chronic bacterial infection of conducting airways @infection >4 weeks that responds to prolonged antibiotics 2 weeks
- treamtent
    + 4 weeks of augmentin that will cover likely. often abx used previously but cough never went away. thus need long term course.
    + minimum 2 week course of antibiotics of augmentin rquired usu to clear
- causative
    + H. influenzae
    + Strep pneumo
    + M. catarrhalis
- clnical
    + daily wet cough lasting >4 weeks
    + non other symptoms of other causes
- DDx
    + in asthma cough is dry, but may coexist
    + iin foreign body may have history of choking, typically younger
    + bronchiectasis: also a wet cough, have history of CF, ciliary dyskinesia, FTT

# Chronic suppurative lung disease
    Causes
        PCD (primary ciliary dyskinesia)
        Immune deficiencies
        Bronchiectsis
        Aspirated foreign body
        Cystic fibrosis
        Tuberculosis
- @chronic inflammation and damage to lung parenchyma == widening of airways with bronchiectasis, fluid accumulation and mucous.
- investigations
    + CXR/ CT 
        * signet ring sign. airway large than surrounding vessel. 
    + LFTs
    + nasal NO (PCD)
    + sweat test (Cl  must be under 40)
    + immunology screening (total IgG)

# Cystic fibrosis
- screening
    + measurement of immune reactive trypsinogen. the highest 1% are then tested for most common CF mutations. then find if they are heterozygeous/ homozgous == then do the sweat test. 
    + @positive sweat test == diagnosed wth CF.

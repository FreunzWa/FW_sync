# Normal Saline is not normal. Not a normal physiological fluid. Recommend just use CSL
- Lactate (the cause is important. sprint == high lactate fine. sepsis == high lactate can indicate fatal)


# Blood gases

- arterial vs venous
    + advise to always go venous (though respiratory physicians argue arterial always better, but they are painful and @++)
    + SpO2 is good enough to detect hypoxemia (unless CI'd eg @shocked/ CO poisoning)
    + pH difference tiny
    + pCO2 difference 6
    + HcO3 difference 1.5
- indications for VBG
    + DKA
    + COPD needing NIV
    + intubated patient
- Stepwise Approach
    + alkalaemic/ acidaemic (pH)
    + respiratory or metabolic (bicarb = metabolic, co2=respiratory)
    + acute or chronic disturbance 
    + HCO3
        * 1-2-3-4 rule 
    + anion gap
        * AG = Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-). Normal is 12
        * AG doesnt really exist bcause electrically neutral, just caused because difference in unmeasured anions.
        * @low albumin == causes low AG 
        * determine whether other meatbolic disutbances co exist with aG cidosis
            - correct he HCO3 and see how close to 24 it is.
            - subtract 12 from the AG and add to the HCO3. if above == metabolic alkalosis co-exists. or under 
        * calculate the expected respriatory response
            - expected CO2 = (1.5 * Bicarb) + 8 +/-2
            - however CO2 wont go over 50-55 to compensate
- specific acid base disorders
    + respiratory acidosis (due to cannot get rid of CO2 by breathing)
        * due to poor gas exchange
        * due to neuromuscular disorders
        * CNS depression 
    + respiratory alkalosis 
        * Gram negative sepsis
        * hypoxia
        * pain
        * heaptic failure
        * pregnancy
    + AG metabolic acidosis
        * caused by Lactate, Ketones, Toxins, Renal Failure
    + Non AG metabolic acidosis
        * USED CRAP
        * too much chloride (eg due to renal failure or @NS iatrogenic -- so now CSL used more), insufficient bicarb (lost through bowel/ urine).
    + Metabolic Alkalsosis
        * fluid responsive (dehydration)
        * Fluid unreponsive

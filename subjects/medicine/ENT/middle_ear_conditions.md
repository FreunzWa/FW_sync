###### Middle ear disease
left ear (handle of the malleus points forward)
tensor keeps the eustachian tube patent. 
cleft palate == middle ear disease @mscle mechanism does not function properly.
infant eustrachian tube is shorter and horizontal. 
middle ear effusion == cannot see through the TM. 
air bubbles @eustachian tube beginning to work
cholestaeatoma
atelectasis of the middle ear
grommets (tube with flanges, for middle ear ventilation)
bullous myringitis - mycoplasma and other species.

# Acute otitis media
- basics
- diagnosis
    + features of acute onset of symptoms, middle ear effusion, sx of middle ear inflammation (redness of the TM)
- medical
    + natural history
        * inflammation settles ==> fluid sits in teh middle ear (otitis media with effusion) == 
            -  eustachian begins to work == reutrns to normal
            - eustachian neve begins to work, then causes chronic effusion which can eventually acuse cholesteatoma/ atelectasis
            - %perforation then
                + returns to normal
                + peristent perforation (esp @poor nutritition, bad environment, SE status)
- rx
    + analgesia: (decongestants no longer recommended)
    + abx:
        * indicated in (<2 years old, immuncompromised, children w bilateral disease, otorrhoea, already deaf in the other side, indigenous populations)
        * amoxicillin is recommended. up to 10 days. @no improvement in 48 hrs, swtich to augmentin.
            - (allergy)==cefuroxime, 

# Chronic otitis media with effusion
- basics
    + chronic infection with fluid accumulation in teh middle ear
- treat
    + insertion of a middle ear ventilation tube (indicated @persistent fluid accumulation for 4 months or more, or in at risk children - eg autism/ vision loss, downs syndrome @E tube deficiency), evaluate every 3 months.

# Chronic suppurative otitis media
- basics
- medical
    + safe vs. unsafe
        * tubotympanic disease (still %of brain abscess)
        * atticoantral == allows cholesteatoma formation 


# Cholesteatoma
- basics
    + non malingant over-keratinization == erosion to underlying bone. 
    + also congenital cholesteatoma
- medical
    + can destroy ossicles, into the brain, facial nerve

# Middle ear effusions
- basics
    + mucoid, serous



# Ear pain differentials
- acute otitis media
- bullous myringitis
- TMJ dysfunction 
- mastoiditis 
- auricular haematoma
- foreign body
- external auditory canal tumor
- middle ear tumors
- referred pain
    + pharyngeal carcinoma
    + CN9,10. eg tnsillitis, carcinoma, pyriform fossa, cervical spine problems (C2,3)

# Discharge differentials
- AOM w/ perforation (sudden resolution of pain)
- chronic perforated TM
- CSOM
- cholesteatoma
- otorrhoea through middle ear ventilation tube

# Hearing loss
- COME
- chronic tympanigc membrane perforation
- middle ear atelectasis
- dislocation secondary to head trauma

# Facial paralysis
- acute otitis media (the facial nerve is involved @passes through teh middle ear, esp in young childrne @no bone covering the CN5)

# Headache
- intracranial absecess secondary to acute otitis media, %spread to sinus system == raised ICP @obstruction. (%associated with diplopia @ICP == pressure on CN6)

# Balance issues
- cholesteatoma eroding into the semicircular canals.

# Tinnitus
- @AOM == transmits sound from carotid
- glomus tumor (paraganglioma), very vascular (so hear constant wooshing sound). similar to carotid body tumor.

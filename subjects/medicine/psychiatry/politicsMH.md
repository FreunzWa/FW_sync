###### Politics MH
- soviet union == institutionalised @nonconformitism

- drapatomania: slaves' intense desire to escape, removal of the patients toes. remained in diagnostic manuals until 1914. 
- US: 1950s: fragmentation of teh personality == calm poorly functioning patient. 
- 1968: ++protests around the world @vietnam war. 2nd iteration: now emphasis on masculinised belligerence, with agitated patients being the primary diagnosis. 
- shyness rebranded as SAD, pharmaceuticals benefitted @SAD diangosis @now treated with SSRI. 
- criminal behaviour could be rebranded as psychiatric pathology == more human treatment of people suffering from mental diseases.

# Criticisms
- ?


why was DSM 'embattled'? because of the subjectivity? exactly it needs to be subjective. -- if the patient is asymptomatic, but investiations are posistive then you give disanoigss and treat an asymptomatic patient. -- problem with psychiatry @no imaging etc.

welfare for psychiatric patients. 
TAFE: vocational training delivered @expense of the workers. now the cost of training is borne b would-be workers. this model implies that peple shouldnt receive too much help. dependence is 

expansion of diagnoses == more treatment for people suffering from supposed mental illnesses. 

negative affect: outcome of invalid reasoning

happiness correlated with increased hysical movmenet?
surveillance incorporated into mental health treatments? 

possible that treamtent within mental health permitted accoridng to authorities but still ehtically dubious.

presentations -- what ? ? ? 

abilify -- digitally check compliance, but articles were scathing. 3rd parties conducting surveillance of their bodies against their will. 

alleged euthanasia of woman in netherlands. 

example of BPD:
idea for diagnosis is from the us several decades ago
border bwetween psychosis and neurosis (borderline)
personality traits held consistent over adult life
DSM traits (depression, imulsivity, unstable self image, etc.)
kinds of criteria are extremely everyone. to different degrees. very much in subjective territory. 
what is a personality?? no one knows he says. 
borderline diagnosis 75% of BPD diagnoses
in UK/ AUS, the term borderline has become synonymous with 'difficult'
pop culture, now men rights activists call women borderline (MRA - mens rights associations)
trauma is one of the signficiant etiological facotrs
clear example of intersection between politics and mental health
good patient is a lifter not leaner
shows how category conceived poorly deliberately, now to be used to label women. 
assimiliating individual into general diagnositc category then giving a generalised treatmeetn. 

-- many dont use the DSM
- stigma 
- problematic

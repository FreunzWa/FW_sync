---------------------------------------------------



---------------------------------------------------

# Epidemiology
- 15-20% of population in lifetime
    + W:M 2:1, however Males 4x more likely
- 4% in the last month
- ~50% recur, and those with 3+ episodes 80% have recurrent chronic depression
- moderate depression usually lasts for 9 months when untreated
- 2x mortality at any age due to exposure to other risk factors
- risk factors:
    + childhood trauma, traumatic episodes, adversity (ruminative vs. active response)
    + drug use (esp alcohol, GABAergic medications)

-------------------------------------------------------

# As a psychosocial disorder/ predisposing factors
- as a child:
    + parental loss/ poor parenting predisposes to adult depression, also includes disengaged depressed mothers (eg with post partum depression). 
    + higher IQ is protective, as well if there is at least one good relationship
    + CSA, increased risk of affective/ personality/ mood disorders
- adult:
    + risk of depression: continuously married < always single > divorced and then separated
    + increasd risk @dysfunctional intimate other   
- environmental factors:
    + entrapment (most common), danger, humiliation, loss (bereavement)

# Medical 
- associations
    + alcohol, drug abuse, self-medication to decrease anxiety symptoms 
    + Anxiety disorder (usually predates depression)
    + personality disorder (treated in parallel)
- mechanism
    + first episode of depression 
        * usu associated with lifestyle facotrs, then relapse 
    + brain structure changes
        * @longer/ severe course of depression assoc with small hippocampus, ventriculomegaly, -=activation of BDNF, -=reponse to dexamethesane suppression test, changes to HP axis. 

# Diagnosis
- Criteria/ Definition in DSM-5
    + 5 of the following (of 8 symptoms):
        * at least one of the following:
            - Anhedonia 
            - Depressed mood

            - inability to concentrate
            - loss of energy/ chronic fatigue
            - psychomotor retardation
    + Adjunct
        * With anxious distress
        * With mixed features
        * With melancholic features
            - A - 1/2 
                + loss of pleasure in all/ almost all activities
                + lack of reactivity to usu pleasurable stimuli (does not feel better at all when something good happens)
            - B - 3+ 
                + mood - severely depressed/ despaired/ despondent
                + depression worse @morning

                + significant weight loss/ anorexia
                + excessive guilt
        * With atypical features
        * With psychotic features


# Classification 

- Winokurs Depressive spectrum
    + states that men present differently to women with the following constellation of symptoms
        * antisocial , alcohol abussing, angry, restive
- medical
    + prognosis
        * major complication is suicidal ideation, which maybe a marker of severity

# Clinical assessment
+ differentials
    * Other psychiatric disorders
        - Borderline personality disorder
    * Organic conditions
        - Loss significant
        - Hypothyroidism
        - Cushings
        - Cancer (up to 1/3 of people with cancer has depression)
        - Neurological (depression common post stroke - esp if the infarct, PArkinsons)
        - Multiple sclerosis (may present as depression initially)
        - HIV
+ presentation
    * Neuro-vegetative symptoms
        - Sleep disturbance (terminal insomnia), libidinal changes
    * Cognitive-affective symptoms
        - anxiety, helplessness, social withdrawal, guilt, shame, rage, nihilism, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, worthlessness/ inferiority complex
    * Suicidal ideation
        - may be a marker of severity
        - associated with the following symptoms:
            + insomnia, worthlessness, weight/appetite loss, guilt, thoughts of death, impulsive (lack of planning)/ aggressive
            + phase of recovery (risk of suicidality can increase with treatment in early stages @psychomotor retardation goes away but mood/ affect lag behind)
    * Psychotic symptoms (a marker of severity, mood congruent delusions - that is the psychotic symptoms reflect the underlying mood)
        - 10-20% hallucinations
        - ~100%delusions
        - %constipation (due to psychomotor retardation/ -=mobility == constipation which may cause delusions) 
        - these symptoms are often missed


# Treatment
- indications for ECT (more severe depression is responsive)
    + melancholic depression 
    + psychotic depression
    + dipolar depression/ mani
    + prominent suicidality
    + poor oral intake
    + puerperal depression

# Variants
- Postpartum depression  
    + 10% of mothers, 50% of these episodes are severe
    + occurs 4-12 weeks post partum
    + 50% risk of recurrence
    + impact on development of the child
    + suicide is the leading cause of maternal death
    + often associated with thyroiditis
- Child Depression 
- Depression older age (>65)
    + usu @bereavement, financial concerns.
    + irritable > sad (esp the males)
    + organic disorders as precipitants are more frequent
    + somatic complaints (with increased pain esp neuropathic, reduced function from baseline)


-------------------------------------------------
# Psychotic depression (Major depressive disorder with psychotic features)
- basically means delusions or hallucinations are present
    + either mood congruent (like bad stuff happening in the delusions/ halluciantions) or mood-incogruent
- seems similar to schizoaffective disorder, depression type. but to get diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, there must be a history of delusions/ hallucinations occuring in the absence of a depressive episode, which is not a feature of psychotic depression:
        * "=" period of mood depression
        * "x" psychotic period
schizoaffective disorder depression type:
 xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxx
    ====   =====   ==========   ======
(can see that depression occurs even when there is not psychotic symptoms, but psych symptoms can occur when there is no depression)

MDD with psychotic features: 
 =========   ==== ===========   ====
 x xxx xx    xxx   x x x xxx     x x 
(see that psychotic symptoms can ONLY occur when there is a depressive episode)






# Unspecified depressive disorder
- used @not enough information to make full diagnosis

# Other specified despressive disorder
- @insuffient symptoms to get diagnosis
- types
    + recurrent breif depression (2-13 days recurrent )
    + short duration depressive peisode (4-13 days -- importantly less than the 2 weeks required @MDE diagnnosis)
    + depressive episode with insufficient symptoms

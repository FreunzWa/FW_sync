- clinical
    + presentation

    + SAD, perforamnce only (rarer, when SAD sx only come @performing eg @giving a speech) == the old term of non generalised SAD
- treatment
    + organise followups
    + CBT
    + pharma
        * monotherapy trialled first, usu SSRI. only partially effecgive, may require augmentation therapy -- combination with:
            - buspirone, clonazepam
        * classes
            - SSRI
                + best studied, ++prescribed. Paroxetine common, but no superiority - Sertraline is also used. usu require 4-6 weeks to be effective, 8-16 weeks for maximal efect. 
            - SNRI
                + Venlafaxine appears equally effective
            - MAOi
                + used befroe the SSRIs were invented. poorly tolerated and dietary restrictions. Phenelzine. 
            - BZDs
                + high potency BZDs (alprazolam and clonazepam) are effective for reduction of symptoms. Clonazepam longer acting is the most commolyused, may be used with SSRI. however can result in SUD.
        * how: generally recommend that they challenge themselves whilst on the meidcaitons so that they learn that these situations are not to be feared. 
        * for non genralised SAD (performanc eonly), better  is short term PRN medications -- BZDs/ Beta blockers

###### Diffuse lung infiltrates - Radiology

# Lymphangitic carcinomatosis
- lymphatic spread of tumor throughout lungs most commonly seen secondary to adenocarcinomas, most commonly @breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, prostate, cervical, thyroid. an end stage manifestation of malignancy.
- usu @haematogneous embolus seeding to the lungs == lymphatic involvement, however @bronchogenic adenocarcinoma == direct invasion into interstitium == spread into lymphatics. 
- @lymphatic congestion == fluid accumulation/ effusions/ RHF
- clinical 
    + presentation
        * sx of pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure/ low grade ever. progressive subacute dyspnoea, %pleurisy, 
        * sns of RHF/ pulmonary hypertension, ++loud P2 of 2nd heart sound, RV heave, cyanosis, RVP increase, tachycardia/ tachypnoea
- investigate
    + bloods
        * ABG (hypoxaemia, resp alkalosis, ++A-a gradient)
    + radio: 
        * interlobular septal thickening (prominent definition of the secondary pulmonary nodules)
        * %kerley B lines
        * thickening ofhte bronchovascular interstitium
        * "dot in box" @centrilobular vascular bundle inside the polygonal interlobular thickening.
        * CT %show gorund glass @interstitial edema, nodular lobule appearance, hilar adenopathy
    + biopsy: definitive transbronchial lung biopsy (TBBX), used @LC and pulmonary tumor emboli.
- treat
    + chemotherapy determined @biopsy of the primary tumor (after detection with CT/ PET). 
    + prognosis: very poor, <12 months avergae survival
- ddx: causes of ILD (sarcoidosis, acute eosininophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organising pnuemoia), pulmonary hypertension (heart fialure, COPD), venous thromboembolism (PE, tumor embolism)

- Breslow thickness
    + this is the actual absolute thickness of the tumor, measured in mm how far the penetration is into the dermis. 
    + Widely used, good indicator of clinical outcome for melanoma. 
- Clark Level
    + this indicates the anatomical level of invasion of the tumor
        * 1: in situ melanoma (all within the epidermis)
        * 2: invasion into the papillary dermis (but not all the way)
        * 3: throughout the papillary dermis (all the way but not into reticular dermis)
        * 4: invasion into the reticular dermis
        * 5: invasion into the subcutaneous tissue

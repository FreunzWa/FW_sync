###### Palliative approach to pathology

# Bowel obstruction
- AXR erect and supine, CT @negative XR, UEC, Coags
- @single level bowel obstruction, in FS patient == bypass operation/ stenting
- @multi level bowel obstruction, or NFS patient take conservative approach:
    + palliate symptoms 
    + attempt to reverse medically 
        * dexamethasone (antiinflammatory == -=swelling esp @tumor causing obstruction, also anti-secretory, anti-emetic)
        * ranitidine (H1 blocker == -=secretions == -=bulk of mass)
        * octreotide no longer used


# Hypercalcemia
- often @paraneoplastic syndromes of certain tumor types (SCLC, lymphoma, myeloma @PTH related peptide, or PTHRP). generally a sign of advanced metastatic disease. 
- rx
    + rehydration therpay w/ normal slaine/ CSL
    + OC inhibition to prevent activity of PTHRP (denosumab or the potent bisphosphonates like zolendronic acid)

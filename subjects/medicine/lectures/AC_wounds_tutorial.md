###### Chronic wounds
further reading:
- incontinence associated dermatitis
- skin tear

inflamm phase in elderly more marked and persistent == dont progress into epithelialisation.
venous most common cause of leg ulcerations

Ddx:
 - venous/ neuropthiac/ arterial 
 - mycobacterium ulcerans - buruli ulcer
 - malignancy

Investigate
- PCR (buruli)

# Buruli ulcers

# Skin tear
- traumatic wound @friction/ %idiopathic. @epidermis separated from dermis. avoid soap to prevent dessication, keep skin moisturised. category 3 @completely absent flag == refer to plastics. otherwise stop bleeding, clean with saline and keep as much of skin tag as possible.
    + 1a/b, 2a/b, 3 categories
    + foam dressing on skin tear, arrow needs to be drawn from the side of the pedicle of the skin tag.

# Incontinence associated dermatitis
- basics
    + ++@patients with incontinence
- treat
    + nursing aid: skin prtectant, cleansing, changing incontinence equipment as necessary
    + add anti-candida treatment (eg clotrimazole)

# Venous ulcers 
- @venous hypertension (either superficial or deep) == ulceration.
- appearance: flat, position, assoc with surrounding venous eczema
- rf
    + varicose veins/ recurrent DVTs/ HFpEF/ obesity/ sarcopaenia (-=venous return), DM, limb immobilisation/ OA/ chronic pain etc.
- treat
    + surgical
        * phlebectomy/ sclerotherapy to ablate varicosities
        * debridement (eliminates biofilm)
    + dressing/ compression
        * wet dressings + compression
        * types of compression
            - Class 1/2/3 (3 often not tolerated). indications depend @severity of disease.
            - dont compress @co-incident arterial insufficiency/ DM mediated neuropathy (cannot detect compression)
- investigate
    + 1.0 normal. >1.2 suggested calcified vessels. <0.3 == critical limb ischaemia
    + toe pressures: avoids major artery calficications, for use in diabetes (this group has ++Ca of vessels)
        * toe pressure > 30 mmHg "ability to heal", but this figure probably too low. >80mmHg == reassuring.
    + wound swab
        * firm rubbing over the most infected area "Levine technique"


# Pressure injuries
- basics
    + ++@sacrum/ heels
- clinical
    + rf
        * urinary incontinence (wet perineum), immobility, malnutrition, neurological disease
- Staging (Stage 1-2 easier to treat)
    + Stage 1: intact skin with unblanchable redness 
    + Stage 2: partial thickness loss of dermis. A shallow ulcer or blister.
    + Stage 3/4 much worse: Stage 3: full thickness tissue loss. no bone muscle/ tendon
    + stage 4: visibile bone/ muscle/ tendon
    + Unstageable @cannot see the base
- treat
    + limited evidence, but: pressure relieving mattresses, second hourly turns, %nutritional supplementation 


*(NERDS) Critical colonisation (not necessarily systemic Abx, dress, %oral Abx @worrying - the more signs the worse)
Non healing
exudative
red and bleeding
debris
smell

Stones ()
size bigger
temp increased
os (can probe bone?/ exposed bone)
new area breakdown
erythema, exudate
smell


esophageal stricture ==> malnutrition ==> fe deficiency aneamia ==> heart failure ==> edema ll ==> pressure ulcers 



# Dressing types
- foam is the safest

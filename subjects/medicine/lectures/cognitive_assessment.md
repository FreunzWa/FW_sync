- limitations
    + must account for language barriers, so use interpretors. 
    + education barriersa
    + limb disturbance
    + visual disturbances
    + doesnt test executive function (so people with FTD, or with frontal dementia may score well still in the test)

- introducing the test:
    + these are standardized questions, just testing your memory etc .
    + to note:
        * get them to spell world forward first
        * answer the questions at the end for you
        * if they you to repeat, just repeat the question word for word up to 3 times.
        * allow spelling mistakes but must be a sentence.
        * for the drawing task, must have a diamond, both shapes must have the correct number of sides.
        * subtract 7 from each number until tell you to stop, 5 times count backwards (same letters as word (get a point for each one that is correct)

# MOCA
- moca was developed for poeople with mild cognitive impairment
- mainly for people scoring >25 on MMSE. used when there is some suspicion of issues. little bit more challenging than the other tests.

# RUDAS
- rudas developed for patients in which english is not first language and also to elimiate educational bias. 
- test slightly different things from the MMSE
- has some level of executive function testing.


in clinic the geriatrician tends to do both RUDAS and SMMSE asthe tests yield different types of information

###### Urogenital imaging

# Case 1
- female with recurrent UTI/ flank pain
- calculus throughout entire collecting system
- "Staghorn calculus" @conforms to the collecting system

# Case 2
- CT shows horsehoe kidney, a developmental disorder
- kidneys more prone to infections/ trauma, but usu incidental.
- recurrent calculus formation @doesnt drain normally.
- can actually see the kindeys on an erect Xray, and mak the diangosis.

# Case 3
- can see renal calculsu in teh left ureter with upstream dilatation @obstruction (mild), caclyceal distortion and perinephric fat stranding
- possible to get rupture of the calyceal system == can use IV contrast to show leakage of contrst into the peritoneum
- do an Xray after CT (but not before!), to check if you can see the stone. always CT first because you can visualise the complications of the stone. can only follow up with xray if the stoen is radioapoaque.
- incidental renal cyston teh left kidney. good to do teh HU in ocmparison of the renal cyst fluid to the bladder interir.

# Case 4
- polycystic kidney disease
- right sided previous nephrectomy
- liver manifestations with cysts

# Case 5
- right flank pain and weight loss
- can see massive utmor on posterror surface of the kidney, heterogenous, well demarcated, central necrosis/ fluid filled areas.
- look for neighbouring vessels @renal tumors have a tendency of invading vessels.

# Case 6 (testicular torsion)
- right sided testicular pain
- hypoechoic region in posterior region of testicle, more geterogenous and larger/ bulky posteriorly.
- doppler shows no flow.

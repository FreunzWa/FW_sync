###### L1: Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment
- considerations in caring for older patients
- assessments in form of CGA aim to determine what the patients' special requirements are in being cared for
- health issues (geriatric syndromes)
    + falls
    + cognition/ affective disorders/ delirium
    + chronic pain/ chronic wounds

# Case 1
- 88F pw worsening short term memory ==> memory clinic + collateral history
    + memory history
        * determine episodic memory intact? implicit memory? 
            - short term memory loss to determine if can form new episodic memories
        * time course - triggers?
        * family history of dementia
    + impact on life
        * problems with conversation?
        * memory?
        * driving
        * getting lost?
        * occupational
    + medications
- MMSE
    + 1/3 episodic recall, 2/5 attention, unable to copy overlapping pentagons
- impression  
    + mild dementia @functional impact (MCI is when there is no significant functional impact)
    + likely AD - hippocampal atrophy == inability to form episodic memories
    + Vascular dementia - can have attention deficits ==> causing memory loss
- plan
    + investigations (monitoring / diagnosis)
        * MRI brain, 
            - ?hippocampal atrophy (confirmation of clinical diagnosis)
            - visualise white matter ischaemic damage
        * Neuropsychological assessment
        * blood tests
            - vitamin/ nutrition
            - thyroid
        * POA appointment
        * Medications
            - Cholinesterase inhibitors
                + Used in the early stages of the disease, may improve episodic memory for a period
        * Serial cognitive assessment
    + Medical/ Health conditions and Medications
        * T2DM optimisation (HbA1c - high or low)
        * OSA (sleep may be affecte - what is current control, compliant with CPAP?, symptomatic with daytime somnolence?)
        * Medications review: Targin? 
    + Psych/ Social factors
        * Affective disorders - esp depression == pseudo-dementia (use GDS)
        * anxiety can impact on sleep
        * social isolation/ ability to engage with commuity.
- further hx
    + husband died == isolated @cannot drive == social isolation
    + GDS to guage degree of depression
- management plan
    + wean targin @not effective, explore other options
    + arrange CPAP review
    + try an antidepressant
    + obese? weight loss?
    + reassess cognition following these interventions.

# Case 2
- 75Fpw fall/ right knee skin tear
- simple cold fall
    + address injuries
    + simple analgeisa locally
    + consider physio
    + occupational assessment? 
- T2DM review - can cause postural hypotension, hypoglycaemic
- Anxiety - important @anxiety attack. fear of falling == change walking == more likely to fall
- BZD medication == could be contributing @slows reactions time
- rx
    + wean valium


# Case 3
duodart

# functioanl assessment
- slow gait speed == ++falls/ associatiogn with dementia
- grip strength (sarcopaenia)
- time and up and go

# Mental + Cognitive
- GDS

# Nutritional
- mini nutrition assessment

###### Maternal collapse
    unexpected disturbance of consciousness, esp @poor cerebral perfusion @circulatory dysfunction
# Hypotensive maternal collapse
- hypovolaemia (JVP down, feels cold)
    + hemorrhage (concealed and revealed must be considered)
- acute vasodilation (JVP down, feels warm)
- cardiogenic (JVP up)
    + outflow obstruction (air embolus, amniotic fluid embolism, aortic dissection, aortic stenosis, Thromboembolism)
    + pump failure (vasovagal - {cervical shock, uterine inversion} AMI, cardio)
    + arrhythamia (long QT, local anaesthetic toxicity)

# Respiratory
- aspiration of gasric contents @pressure of gravid uterus on stomach and relxation of esophageal sphincter and slowed gastrice emptying
- asthma
    + %precipitated by prostaglandins/ anti-inflammatory drugs, labetalol
- pneumothorax (straiing in 2nd stage of labor)

# Neurological
- drugs
    + excessive magnesium sulphate/ narcotics == drowsiness/ LOC
- hypoglycaemia
    + @diabeteic patiet (vomiting often precipitates)
- stroke
    + esp @hypertensive disorders/ severe pre-eclampsia
    + SAH more likely @straining in second stage of labor



---------------------------

# Amniotic fluid embolism
    esp @small partial thickness tear in teh lower uterine segment. (similar causes to uterine rupture). @amniotic fluid in pulmonary circulation == afeterload effect on right side of heart with acute pulmonary hypertension == capillary damage. causes DIC @thromboplastin in the amniotic fluid 
- rf
    + small partial thickness tear (hypertonic uterine rupture -- ask for augmented labor)
    + neglected obstructed labor
- clinical
    + acute onset SOB, cyanosis, pallor, chills, restless %convusions. 
    + cardiogenic shock
    + features of DIC
- treatment 
    + full resp/ circulatory support
    + correction of clotting factor deficiencies

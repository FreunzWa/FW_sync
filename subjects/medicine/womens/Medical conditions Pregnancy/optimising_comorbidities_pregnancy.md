###### Optimising co-morbidities in pregnancy
    always about the effect ofc pregnancy on disease (more so neglected) and vice versa.
    Four components of optimising a condition:
        1. effect of pregnancy on disease (EPD)
        2. effect of disease on pregnancy (EDP)
        3. Assess + optimise (optimise)
        4. medication review (meds)


# Diabetes
- EPD
    + increased insulin requirements
    + increased hypoglycaemia
    + DKA rare
- EDP
    + icnreasede risk of basically everything
        * miscarriage, FDIU, structural, PET/PPROM/ polyhydramnios
- optimise
    + aim HbA1c <6.5% to start pregnancy, pregnancy totally CI @>8% or active end organ dysfunction (Eg retinopathy, nephropathy, microvascular disease)
    + assess prenatal for micro/macrovascular complications
    + get an endocrine revieew, dietitian and encourage weight loss
- meds
    + 5mg folate (@increased risk of NTDs)
    + @on OHA (esp @not metformin) then consider changing to insluin
    + optimise any anti-HTs, cease any statins or oother lipid lowering agents

# SLE
- EPD
    + ++risk of flare, esp @recent flare within 6/12 of conception
    + thuis delay pregnancy until at least 6/12 after lupus nephritis flare
    + @lupus nephritis == 30% risk of renal fialure in prengancy, with a 7% risk of permanent renal deterioration
        * @Cr > 177 == advise against pregnancy
- EDP
    + ++loss
    + %neonatal lupus (@passage of anti-Ro/ La antibodies), %heart block, %cutaneous neonatal lupus
- optimise
    + screen for APLS
- meds
    + stop MTX, mycophenolate, cyclophophsamid
    + stop NDSAIDs/ ACe inhibitors



# Asthma
- EPD
    + mild disease fine
    + severe disease ++%flare esp @late pregnancy
- EDP
    + usu no effect unless poorly controlled == chronic hypoxaemia == IUGR/ TNT/ neontal hypoglycaemia, neonatal seizures, %mild association with PET
- optimise
    + RFTs to determine severity
    + optimise inhaler technique
    + good asthma management plan
    + avoid RFs for exacerbation eg smoking
- meds
    + all medications safe during preg + breast feeidng


# Hyperthyroidism
- EPD
    + worse in T1 @bHCG similar a-subu
- EDP
    + loss, PTB
    + %neontal thyrotoxicosis (which has highm mortality). require matenral anithyroid meds
- optimise
    + baseline TFTs + antibodies
    + %ultrasound of the thyroid
    + control hyperthyroisim with antithyroid meds
* meds
    - PTU can be used in T1
    - carbimazole can be used after (can cause anaplasia cutis @T1)

# Hypothyroidism
- EPD
    + %increasded thyroxine requirements
- EDP
    + @untreated == loss, IUGR, PTB, aenamia, abruption, PET
- optimise
    + baseline TFTs + anti TPO and TG abs and treat
- meds
    + thyroxine safe in pregnancy


# Chronic HTN
    @persistent BP >140/90
- EPD
    + BP may actually normalise in T1, but accelerate HT in T3
- EDP
    + ++risk of (PET, PNM, abruption, IUGR, PTB)
- optimise
    + rule out secondary cause (eg renal, endocrine, collagen vascular disease)
    + assess for end organ damage (renal, cardiac)
    + diet + exercise
- meds
    + avoid B-blockers (IUGR risk) -- labetalol can be used however
    + cese all diuretics
    + cease lipid lowering agents

# Epilepsy
- EPD
    Epilepsy usu stable 65%, however 15% worsen. eg @strress, decreased AED levels, increased clearance
    risk of seizures is highest peripartum period
- EDP
    + only status epilepticus is dangerous for mother and fetus
- optimise
    + consider neurologist review
    + consider an EEG
- meds
    + high dose folate @using an AED
    + use lowest possible dose of AED, avoid valproate if possible. 
    + @seizure free for 2 years+ then consider discontinuing AEDs pre-conceptually. withdrawal at least 6 months prepregnancy to see how go

# Cardiac disease 
- EPD
    + poorer outcomes @NYHA > 2, previous caridac effect or valvular left heart obstuctiopn or with LVEF < 40%
- EDP
    + ++risk of maetnral mortality, PTB
    + @congenital lesion, then increased risk of neontal cardiac abnormnalitity esp @ASD (5-10%)
- optimise
    + get TTE/ ECG/ operative reports to assess severity
    + %surgical repair pre-pregnancy @severe
- meds
    + avoid warfarin esp 6-12/ 40 esp @>5mg per day
    + anti-HTN review
    + stop statins etc.

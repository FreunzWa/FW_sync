- Trisomies
    + T21 (downs syndrome)
        * complete/ partial copy of Chr21
        * 1/600 pregnancies

# Screening for trisomies
    analytes of inhibin, estriol, bHCG, aFP are expressed as multiples of median as there are known reference rangees for the population
- first trimester screening
    + combined testing (CFTS)
        * 90% detection rate, 5% FP
        * combination of 
            - serum (taken 9-12 weeks:
                + pregnancy associated plasma protein A
                + hCG
            - imaging (10-13 weeks):
                + nuchal transclucency measurement (11-13 weeks as indicated @CRL) 
- second trimester screening (2TMSS)
    + serum tests
        * blood taken btwn 14-20 wks
        * 75% detection rate, 5% FP when using all 4 parameters
        * serum analytes (measured @multiples of median)
            - fetal
                + alpha-fetoprotein (-=)
                + estriol (-=)_
            - placental
                + bHCG (++)
                + inhibin (++)
    + integrated testing (combined first and second)
        * PAPP-A @9-12 weeks, followed by 2nd trimester serum analytes + T1 transclucency measurement == 90% detection, only 2% FP.
    + 2nd trimester US (routine between 18-22 weeks)
        * soft markers of down syndrome may be seen (such as increased gap between first adn second toe, echogenic bowel, short humerus/ femur)
    + NIPS (non invasive prenatal screening
        * using cell free fetal DNA from plasma of pregnant women. s
        * cffDNA is 10% of total maternal cell free DNA. 
        * detection rate of 99%, 95%, 90% for T21/18/13 respectively. FP <0.5%
        * high cost test, but high accuracy, still requires diagnostic test to follow
- maternal screening results other implications
    + @very abnormal reesults can also mean other problems more likely, may prompt closer monitoring later in pregnancy
    + T1
        * low PAPP-A == ++risk of IUGR, PreEc, stillbirth
        * low b-HCG == ++risk of IUGR
    + T2
        * ++aFP == ++risk of structural defects (NTBs, gastrochisis) == reequires morphology US ongoing
        * low estriol == ++risk of fetal death, smith lemlioptiz sydnrome

# Diagnostic tests
- do not require anaesthetic, US guidedd tests. CVS and AC are options. 
- anti-D given to all RhNegative women.
- risks
    + 1% miscarriage @CVS
    + 0.5% miscarriage @AC
- CVS
    + needle passed into placetal plate and CV are aspirated. 
    + performed @12-14 weeks.
    + performed @abnormal T1 screening (US and serum)
- AC
    + performed @15 weeks -- need more fluid, but later diagnosis
    + aspirate 15 ml of amniotic fluid
- analysis of genetic material
    + FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridisation)
        * probes attach to critical regions
        * result avail in 48 hurs. 
        * determines any Chr abno (sex and autosomal) - -thus can rapidly rule out 13,18,21
    + Banded karytopying -- takes 2 weeks
    + Single gene testing -- done when there is a suspicion of a certain condition eg CCF
    + Microarray



# Screening for other conditions
- CF
    + all newborns are screened
    + antenatal screening involves genetic tests for parents for carrier status. @carriers == can perform diagnostic screen with CVS or AC (using PREPAIR)
- haemoglobinopathies
    + @risk (eg low MCV in mother) or carrier status for parents == can do CVS or AC
    + alpha major incompatible with life. beta major is transfusion dependent.
- FXS/ SMA
    + both covered @PREPAIR, screen parents before pregnancy

# Structural abnormalities
- risks
    + diabetic mother (risk correlated with HbA1c), age of mother, exposure to teratogens and certain infections, folate deficiency in T1
- cardiovascular
    + 0.5-1%, most common structural abnormality
    + septal defects
    + outflow tracts
        * coarctation of the aorta
        * TOF
        * transposition of the great vessels
- NTDs
    + anencephaly (failure of cephalic portion to close == absence of the skull and most fo teh cerebrum)
    + spina bifida 
        * exposure of the meninges == meningocele and spinal myelomeningocele. 
        * %amenable to surgery <26 weeks via hysterotomy to close the neural tube defect.
- GIT abns
    + exomphalos (omphalocele)
        * midline herniation of bowel into the base of the cord, covered @peritoneum and amnion. 
        * ++assocaited with chr abnormalities.
        * requires postnatal surgical closure
    + gastroschisis
        * full thickness paramedian abd wall defect unprotected @peritoneum
        * usu an isolated defect, but associated with FGR in late pregnancy
        * surgical closure and resection of bowel.
- abnormalities of the face
    + cleft lip/ cleft palate
    + rf: family history, AEDs and other teratogens. inadequate folate. 
- fetal tumors
    + sacrococcygeal teratomas
- fetal hydrops
    + fluid accumulation throughout body, 2+ body cavities. 
    + assoc @cardiac failure
    + increases risk of prec @placental edema (mirror syndrome)






# Trisomy 21
- ultrasound features
    + CFST: NT (widedend @++fluid)
    + Morphology scan (soft markers) -- however 15% @normal pregnancy
        * echogenic bowel
        * short humerus/ femur
        * clinodactyly of the fifth finger
        * sandle gap toes

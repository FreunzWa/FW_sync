# Shoulder dystocia
    defined @difficulty and time delay in delivering the fetal shoulders following delivery of teh fetal head. requires additional manoeuvres.
- 0.2-3%
- usually easy to deliver the shoulders, but sometimes stuck == shoulder dystocia. may occur suddenlly @normal cephalic presentation
- medical
    + mx
        * boney obstruction @bisacromial diameter (distance between shoulders) too wide @AP diaeter of maternal pelvis through the birth canal
        * also @cephalic presentation
    + classification by severity
    + Fetal complications
        * fracutres (clavicle, and humerus but the bones heal well w/ benign prognosis)
        * brachial plexus
            - %permanent
            - %transient (most self resolve)
        * cord compression (asyphyxia with hypoxic ischaemic ecenaphlopathy)
        * %%%death @prlonged asyphyxia
    + Maternal complciations
        * birth canal trauma and tears (Grade1-4)
        * %%uterine rupture
        * psychological impact
- clinical
    + risk facotrs
        * idiopathic (>50%)
        * past history of shoulder dystoci with pervious pregnancy
        * strongest assocation macrosomia >4500 g (eg @materal GDM or DM)
        * maternal obesity
        * prolonged labor despite good contractions
        * induction/ augmentation/ instrumental of labor
        * post-term pregnancy
    + diagnosis
        * difficulty delivering head after head with axial traction, head tightly applied to the vulva. 
        * chin retracts into the perineum (the tutrle sign) 'turtling'
- management   
    + aim to -=bisacromial diameter of the fetus
    + WARNINGS
        * NEVER rotate fetal head
        * AVOID excessive axial traction
        * AVOID fundal pressure
    + manoeuvres
        * max 30 seconds per manoeuvre, ask the patient to stop pushing, flat on the back
        * HELPERR 
            - help!
            - evaluate for episiotomy (allows more space for manoeuvres, not usually but may do @to get for posterior arm)
            - legs (McRoberts' manoeuvres) + reposition at the edge of the bed
            - suprapubic pressure
            - internal rotational manoeuvres
            - remove the posterior arm
            - roll the mother to hands and knees (Gaskin) -- but the effectiveness is in question
    + McRoberts (60-90% of cases amenable)
        * abductand hyperflex thigs onto maternal abdomen bil, obening maternal pelvis. one person on each leg.
        * GENTLE downward traction.
        * suprapubic pressure (pulsing pressure  constant or rocking motionto dislodge the shoulders). esp the anterior shoulder
    + If McRoberts does not work, then use Barnum (removal of the posterior arm)
        * remove posterior arm by reaching in, apply pressure to antecubital fossa to flex the elbow in fron the body. then rotate fetus into oblique frame
    + Other internal manoeuvres
        * Rubin II (hand behind baby shoulder exerting pressure to rotate the bay)
        * Rubin II + Woods corkscrew
            - 2 hands to corkscrew the baby
        * reverse corkscrew
    + Gaskin position
        * patient on all 4s
    + last resort
        * Cleidotomy:
            - intentional fracture of clavicle (thumb on anterior clavicle)
        * Zavanelli
            - feta l head is pushed up and held there until CS performed
        * hysterotomy
            - uterus incised and internal attempts made at rotating fetus
        * Symphysiotomy
            - division of the pubic symphysis
- prophylaxis
    + induction of labor for presumed future macrosomia may offer some benefit.

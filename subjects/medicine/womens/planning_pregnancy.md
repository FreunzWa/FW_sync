###### Planning pregnancy


# Pre-pregnancy visit (counselling)
    should do pre pregnancy visit every time a woman of reprodductive age presents. 
    presenting complaints: coming in to talk about getting pregnant, coming in to stop contraception
    3 principles:
        screening to identify isssues
        managing any conditions
        giving general advice.
- presenting issue
    + sexual history -- how long been trytiing to conceive, how having intercouse, how often
- look for problems (HIE)
    + history 
        * allergies and medications
    + examinations
        * height, weight, vital signs
        * external genitalia examination + speculum exammination
        * bimanual examinatiin of the uterus and adnexa
    + investigations
        * serology 
            - rubella and varicella (immunisation status, serology). IgG. 
            - varicella may be omitted if there is a very convincing history of exposure when young
        * pap smear (CST, if pregnant, postpone treatment must be delayed until after pregnancy @too vascular). usu done @pap smear falling in pregnancy (if just had one dont need it)
        * optimise diseases for pregnancy
            - DM (move for tighter control of BSL, move to insulin @some OHG are teratogenic)
            - epilepsy (valproate attempt to switch pre-pregnancy)
            - anticoagulation (warfarin PregX == passes the placenta. so can use LMWH instead @does not pass placenta
        * genetic testing
            - PREPAIR (pre-pregnancy screening of FXS, SMA, CF)
- optimise management of conditions
    + Daibetes
        * tight glucose control will reduce fetal abnormalities -- thus recommend insulin for pre-pregnancy to ensure that sugars are kept as low as possible prior to conception
    + Surgical conditions
        * treatment of high grade intrepithelial neoplsia of the cervix.
- general advice for early stages of Pregnancy
    + advise against pregnancy @contraindications (can recommend surrogacy)
        * renal failure with sig elevated creatinine (creatinine >300)
        * pulmonary hypertension (50% mortality during pregnancy)
        * T1DM, especially if there are systemic complications of the disease.
        * morbid obesity -- elect to defer to allow for weight loss
    + pharmacological
        * folate supplementation (3 months pre-conception to protect against NTD). higher dose if known risk (eg past history of NTD in baby) - 0.5 mg conditions (AEDs -- take 5mg/kg)
        * medications: avoid teratogens (eg medications currently on or occupational exposure). standard eg paracetamol okay. 
    + behavioural
        * getting pregnant (dont save up for a certain day, at least alternate days leading up to ovulation), alcohol (FAS, even low level so should avoid altogether), smoking limit
    + diet  
        * avoid soft cheeses, unpasteurised milk and prepackaged salads.

# Pre-pregnancy screening
- Screening for genetic diseases with carrier genes
    + PREPAIR
        * tests for FX, CF, SMA in the parents (first mother, then father). looks for most variants
        * 1 in 20 people carry one (more common @caucas)
        * should do before pregnancy, but can do in first 12 weeks.
        * @postive result @pregnancy == requires CVS /AC


# Managing medical conditions
    Effect of pregnancy on disease
    Effect of disease on pregnancy
    Management of disease
    Medication review
- eg diabetes
    + pregnancy on disease
        * increased insulin requirements
    + medications
        * 5mg folate required @++risk of NTDs
        * metformin is safe, but not that effective

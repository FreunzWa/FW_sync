###### Cervical cancer

# Oncological subtypes

# Treatment
- LSIL lesions do not generally require treatment
- precancerous abnormalities (HSIL) 
    + techniques
        * wire loop excision (LLETZ procedure) - aka large loop excision of teh transformation zone
            - uses a wire loop to remove abnormal cells from the cervix. takes 15-30 mins. local anaesthetic but %need a GA. 
        * lazer
            - heat from lazer beam to remove abnormal celslf rom cervix and takes 15-30 mins. LA/ GA. 
        * cone biopsy
            - also used to treat very early tumors
            - cone shaped section of cervix contianing abn cells removed. only small number of patients get cone biopsy
            - can cause cervical insufficiency. may require stitch in the cervix to strengten it. 
    + considerations    
        * no sex 4-6 weeks or tampons to allow heal and prevent infection
        * %vaginal bleeding and cramping, ease in abt 2 weeks.
- treatment for cancer
    + cone biopsy
        * %used for very early/ small tumors
    + trachelectomy
        * removal of the cervix. may presere fertility so may be used for younger women
    + hysterectomy + bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
        * dependent on degree of spread
    + lymph node removal
        * %remove lymph nodes in pelvic region, then tested on pathology.

# Pregnancy
- cervical cancer is most commonly diagnosed gynae malignancy during pregnancy, but still very rare. 
- prenatal colposcopy is recommended if HSIL
- treatment during pregnancy is not indicated, and conservative managment of HSIL lesions is recommended.@risks to teh fetus. HSIL management can be defered until deliery.
- important to determine wishes for continuation of pregnancy

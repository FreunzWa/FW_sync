###### Hormone replacement therapy/ Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT)
- originally prescribed @thoguht that reduced risk of osteoporosis and IHD, however now been found to increase risk of IHD/ breast cancer, VTE, stroke. these effects are mostly present in older women with menopausal symptoms (in there 60s, and do not apply as much to 40-50s)
- MHT declined in use after these results in 2002, however found that MHT benefits outweigh risks in most young menopusal women. 

# Menopause
- avg starts at 51, 95% between 45-55. 
- -=ovarian estrogen production == trigger various symptoms
- prominent menopausal symptoms
    + hot flushes (vasomotor symptoms)
    + vulvovaginal atrophy (esp vaginal dryness and dysparenunia) - called genitourinary syndrome of menopause
    + psychological changes (mood disturbance)
    + joint aches/ pain
    + sleep disturbance (esp @hot flashes)
    + migraines
- treatment with HRT is either through oral or local therapy, depedning on the symptom
- classicaly was also used to treat CHD and OP, but actually may increase risk of CHD according to WHI

# Basics
- MHT is the term for both unopposed estrogen use and combined estrogen-progestin therapy. 
    + *ET (unopposed estrogen therapy)*
    + *EPT (estrogen progestin therapy)*
- the progestin prevents estrogen associated endometrial hyperplasia, and is not needed post hysterectomy. it is given cyclically (the number of days/ time depending on the type of estrogen used)
- risk of side effects (esp DVT/ VTE/ Breast Ca/ stroke) is very low for younger women (40-60) esp only @take for 5 years
- primary indications
    + Hot flashes (most common indication, and MHT is the best treatment)
    + GSM (vulvovaginal atrophy with dry vagina/ dyspareunia, UI)
    + also may help with joint pain related to estrogen less and mood lability.
    + migraines (estrogen associated migraines may get worse in menopause, and estrogen therapy can help these)
- no longer used for OP, CHD, cognitive function 
- duration of treatment is recommended for 5 years, or not beyond the age of 60. however the hot flashes us last for 7.4 years, possibly 10 yars.
    + for this purpose, there are non hormonal options hwich can be recommended.
- when stopping MHT, recommend a gradual taper, especially for those with severe vasomotor symptoms (@may get rebound fhot flashes)
    + @stopping = resumption of bone loss, but reduced breast acncer. 


# Adding a progestin
- micronized progesterone is added for people with intact uterus. the only reason progestin is added@ reduces risk of endomtetrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. 
- in the perimenopausal or newly menopasual, progesterone is added in a cyclic fashion (12-14 days of each calendar month). @continuous use == irregular unscheduled bleeding. 
- some women are unable to tolerate cyclic progestin administration. 

# Alternatives
- can also use the OCP, especially in women yet to reach 12 months menses who are having menopasual symptoms who cannot be sure that they are no longer ovulating. 

# Benefits/ Risks of Oral MHT
- Symptomatic
    + Help with symptoms
        * Hot flashes
        * %Libido
        * Dyspareunia
        * Mood lability
    + Side effects
        * Weight gain
        * Migraines with aura
- Disease onset
    + protects against
        * Osteoporotic fracture HR 0.67
        * Diabetes HR 0.65
        * Recurrent UTI (due to related vaginal atrophy)
        * Cataract
        * May protect against OA
    + increased risk of
        * Cholecystectomy
        * Incontinence (oral formulations)
        * Asthma
        * SLE RR 2.5
        * Nephrolithiaisis

# Contraindications to HRT
- Contraindicated @: Breast cancer, CHD, previous VTE/stroke, active liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, high risk endometrial cancer, TIA in the past
- @migraine with aura, better transdermal estrogen
- @1+ week immobilisation, stop 1 week before and after


# Routes
- available @many routes, depending on prefernces/ requirements. route determines dose. 
- women with sx of flushes/ irritability/ insomnia require systemic estrogen
- women with predominantly GSM, can use local lowdose vaginal estrogen
- Systemic therapy
    + PO: first pass metabolism, but has more effects on the liver. (++production of binding globulins). require higher dose @first pass
        * avalabile types of PO
            - Conjugated equine estrogen (CEE)
            - 17-beta E2. structurally identical to human. Must be micronized or the absorption is negligible.
            - plant derived estrogens
- transdermal (esp for women with migraines with aura)
    + many women started on the TD @assoc with less risk of stroke/ VTE/ hypertriglyceridaemia than PO. 
    + esp important TD @risk of VTE (eg FHx)
- oral
    + used @patient preference, esp in younger women
- local (for GSM)
- ring 

# Dosing approach
- usually start with a low dose and increase the dose after a month if teh hot flashes are still present. 

# Other effects of estrogen therapy
- effect on binding proteins
    + oral estrogen increases SHBG (less testosterone), TBG

# Monitoring
- increased rate of breast cancer == routine mammograms and breast examinations are recommended. increased abornal mammograms under MHT. however riskof breats cancer not increased until the 4th year. 

# Treatment of other features of menopause
- SSRI for depression




------------------------------
# Brands/ Medications
- Tibolone
    + also has androgenic effects, so may have better benefits for libido
        * cons
            - however androgenic side effects == acne, hair loss. 
            - increased risk of breast cancer @Fhx (OR 1.5)



# Non hormonal options
- vasomotor symptoms
    + clonidine 
        * marginal efficacy
    + SSRIs
        * venlafaxine has the best evidence
    + Gabapentin
        * however has bad side effects

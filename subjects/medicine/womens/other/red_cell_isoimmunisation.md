###### Red cell alloimmunisation
    alloimmune disorders (antibody against something the mother does not have, so the mum's body attacks the baby)
    autoantibodies, attacks the mother as per normal, 

# Alloimmune disease in the mother
- thyroid autoimmune disease
    + Graves disease/ Hashimotos' disease abs cross placenta, however @conventional treatment also crosses the placenta.
    + antiAbs half life <3 months == not an issue after birth
    + however @thyroid ablation == still crosses placenta == baby gets severe thyroid disease
- connective tissue diseases
    + SLE: anti-dsDNA == failure to thrive in the fetus 
    + Sjogrens: anti-Ro/ La antibodies == fetal heart esp in bundle of His == risk of complete heart block and cardiomyopathy
- immune thyrombocytopaenic pupura (ITP - most common autoimmune condition)
    + fetal thrombocytopaenia: treated with immunoglobulin (-=the autoantibody) and corticosteroids, this usually treats the fetus as well. 

# Maternal iso-antibodies (aka allo-antibodyies) - non red cell 
- perinatal allo-immune thrombocytopaenia
    + spontaneous bleeding @mucous sites and brain
    + treated with immunoglobulin @suppressess Ig production.
- perinatal allo-immune neutropaenia
    + not an issue in utero
    + bacterial sepsis
    + isolation, antibiotics, donor Ig to boost immune stocks, G-CSF. (no white cells @graft vs. host disease!)

# Red cell alloimmunisation
    85% @anti-D iso-immunisation
    practically best to assume that the fetus might be positive until it is tested @birth.

- red cell antigens that are targets
    + types of red cell antigens that are problemtatic
        * Rhesus D/E/c/K (anti-D is the largest problem)
        * Kell/ Kidd/ Duffy (antiAbs also kill bone marrow - that is why Kell kills == more profound anaemia)
        * MNS (anti M/N/S)
    + harmless
        * ABO: anti-A and B are harmless @IgM does not pass into the fetus @placenta
        * Lewis: fetal red cell does not express the lewis antigen
        * P antigens: IgM
- epidemiology
    + 99% have no abs to red cells. 85% are anti-RhD. 15% others.
- consequences to the neonate (abs remain after pregnancy)
    + mild (usu ab titre <32)
        * mild jaundice
    + moderate (usu ab titre 64-256)
        * severe jaundice (kernicterus)
        * mild anaemia
    + severe
        * severe anaemia (usu ab titre >512)
        * hydrops (generalised edema, pericardial effusion and ascites)
        * FDIU
- pathophysiology
    + primary immunisation
        * blood transfusion (blood is usu matched only for ABO and Rh. sensitised to other antigens == may impact future/ current pregnancy)
            - Kell positive blood usu only given to men OR women past childbearing age
            - no efforst made to avoid c, E, Duffy, M
        * feto-maternal hemorrhage (as small as 0.1 ml may cause primary immune resopnse)
            - spontaneous: usually after 28 weeks, unlikely early @pregnancy == anti-D not routinely given 
            - trauma (CVS, amniocentesis, ECV @breech baby, MVA)
                + amniocentesis usu only small 
            - most commonly @delivery == immunisaton for next pregnancy
                + delivery further boosts the titre if prev small feto-maternal hemorrhage (secondary exposure == ++high levels)
    + secondary immune reaction
        * transfer of maternal IgG high @towards end of pregnancy (physiological surge to equip newborn with infection)
        * == bilirubin release (cleared @maternal supply)
        * == anaemia (@severe) == %hydrops @heart failure
    + severity based on antigen involved
        * ABO - less severe but more common. most commonly present with jaundice, %requires phototherapy
        * RhD - more severe, less common.
- management
    + first antenatal visit
        * iso-immunisation assessment
            - partner grouping
                + if partner negative, then no risk of red cell alloimmunisation
                + if homozygous == 100% affected. 50% affected @heterozygous
            - fetal DNA testing
                + amniocentesis (not CVS @risk feto maternal hemorrhage)
            - risk allocation
                + based on the Ab titre 
        * all women are tested for anti-red cell antibodies.
        * book in for specialist maternal/fetal medicine practitioner
    + according to risk
        * 28 weeks onwards the anti-D Ab titre is taken, prior to administration of antiD
        * low risk
            - Ab titre (by dilution) at each visit, take a titre every 4 weeks , and then 2 weeks after 28 weeks
            - @stays stable == deliver @38 weeks @there is a large rush of Abs across placenta late preg which may cause severe reaction
                + MCA Doppler: peak systolic velocity (-=viscosity of blood == ++velocity.) measured as multiples of mean.
        * medium risk
            - Ab at each visit
            - US screening from 20 weeks (MCA)
                + MCA (increase @hypoxia == vasodilation)
            - CTGs from 32 weeks
            - deliver 38 weeks or earlier to reduce Ab load.
        * high risk
            - US screening from 17 weeks. (before this placenta is not permeable enough)
            - @evidence of fetal anaemia == take blood from ubilicus to see if aenamia. @anaemic == fetal irradiated blood transfusion (remove white cells to stop graft vs. host)
                + use mothers type @the mother will not have that antibody against that red cell type (the antigen in question)
                + give O -ve in general.
                + giving mothers blood okay as long as spin off the plasma. (however not a long term solution)

        * transfusion:
            - paralyse the baby with fecuronium
            - US guided intrahepatic portion of UA blood transfusion. (cordocentesis) and also intraperitoneal cavity of fetus == absorbed gradually
- prevention    
    + if need blood tranfusion, use RhD compatible blood 
    + Kell Negative blood to women under 50 years (men given kell positive blood)
    + anti-D given (stops the white cells from detecting the red cells with D antigen)
        * given whenever there is bleeding in pregnancy/ routine at 28 weeks and 34 weeks
        * no point in giving it if she is already immunised (eg with a high antibody titre)


# Screening
- all women 
    + first antenatal visit
        * blood group genotyping
        * blood group antibodies
    + 28 weeks gestation 
        * blood group antibodies

# Investigations
- genotyping
    + mother genotyped @first antenatal visit, allow with Rh-D Ab titre == risk stratification
    + genotype partner @feasible
    + @partner heterozygote == cell free DNA of the fetus to determine genotype
- US
    + PSV of the MCA of fetus
- Kleihauer test
    + performed @potential sensitising event for Rh-ve mother to determine amnt of anti-D required to neutralise the D antigen
- CTG
    + sinusoidal pattern is a late sign of fetal anaemia
- fetal blood sampling (FBS)
    + @suspicious of fetal anaemia @MCA PSV == fetal blood sampling
    + ultrasound guided sample of fetal blood in umbilical cord/ ductus venosus to determine anaemia

# Management
- passive anti-D
    + given to mother whenever potential for fetal-maternal hemorrhage (@birth, trauma eg CVS, AC, ECV, early pregnancy bleeding, spontaneous 28 and 34 weeks, TOP, EP, cordocentesis, abdominal trauma, revealed or concealed APH)
    + ideally given <72 hours of the sensitising event. within 72 hours of pregnancy @baby is RhD
    + routine
        * 28 and 35 GA == give anti-D (@no previous anti-D Abs)
- intrauterine blood tranfusion
    + indications: FBS shows anaemia, fetal hyrops, AC shows elevated bilirubin
    + provides blood to Rh positive fetus @fetal RBCs haemolysed @maternal reaction. --- usu give type O Rh -negative
    + usu delivered @umbilical vein/ artery, through thematernal abdomen
    + fetal movement stopped @fecuronium == may take few hours for mother to be able to feel moveents again
    + donor blood negative for the antigen
    + often needed twice weekly @first, then decreasing @fetal blood changes to donor (decreased to four-weekly) 
    + may cause supression of fetal erythropoiesis causing a later onset anaemia more mild after delivery
    + risks: infection, preterm labor
- delivery
    + weigh benefits of preterm delivery and continued transfusion. 
    + usu not tranfuse >35 weeks

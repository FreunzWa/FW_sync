###### Pelvic organ prolapse
    normal anaotmy @interaction of CT called endopelvic fascia and the pelvic floor muscles.
[tendinous arch of pelvic fascia; from lower part of PS to spine of ischium is thick white band of pelvic fascia. weakess of this == ipsilateral vagina falls]
- basics
    + organs that prolapse: bladder, rectum, pouch of douglas and small bowel @weakness in the pelvic floor (@ligaments, fasica, musculature waekness caused @denervation, ++abdo pressure, hormonal deficiency)
- anatomy   
    + pelvis
    + normal support @connective tissue (endopelvic fascia), pelvic floor muscles (levator ani - PR, ). 
    + condensation of CT with parietal fascia called the arcus tendineus formed 
    + 3 layers of support
        * level 1 (APEX): supports upper vagina and uterine cervix to latero-posterior pelvis. Supported @cardinal-uterosacral ligaments
        * level 2: 
            - endopelvic fascia
            - lateral (paravaginal) support of the bladder, middle 2 quarters of the vagina and rectum
        * level 3:
            - deep support near perineal body, fusion of lower vagina to perineal membrane
            - support lower quarter of vagina and rectum
- types of prolapse into vaginal wall
    + cystocele: upper anterior vaginal wall
    + apical descent - uterine/ vault prolapse, enterocele may cause this
    + enterocele - upper posterior vaginal wall, loops of small bowel
    + rectocele - lower posterior vaginal wall
    + procidentia (inversion of the vaginal cavity externally)
    + urethral prolapse, lower anterior vaginal wall
- medical
    + complications
        * posterior wall tear %== constipation @obstruction of rectal opening
        * evisceration @perforation of pelvic viscus
    + associations
        * %associated with FI/ UI @underlying tear
    + etiology
        * @weakness of anatomical levels of support, ligaments, muscles, levator ani weakneess @trauma and aging.
- risk factors:
    + past pregnancy (esp vaginal delivery/ instrumented delivery)
    + age
    + menopause @estrogen deficiency
    + previous pelvic surgery/ hysterectomy
    + obesity (++abdo pressure)
    + denervation / neurological disease
    + congential defects (collagen dysfunction syndromes)
    + high impact activities/ heavy lifting
- clinical
    + usu referred by GP, eg after pap-smear is taken
    + history
        * often asymptomatic init, 50% parous women having descent of Aa into lower vgina.
        * sensation of bulge out of vagina/ pressure in pelvic region
        * %assoc with UI/ constipation/ FI
        * %worried about physical appearance
    + examination (supine, knees bent, labia parted, look at each compartment of the vaginal canal)
        * perineum inspection
            - dove tail sign (lack of rugae around anal sphincter between 11 and 1 o clock)
        * coughs/ pushing (detect furhter prolapse)
        * bivalve speculum (cervix vis)
        * sims speculum  (left lateral position, easier to assess prolapse)
        * rectal examination (may show posterior wall prolapse causing obstruction to rectum)
- assessment/ classification
    + Baden walker not used as much
    + POP-Q
        * cm in reference to the hymenal ring remnant, 6 mobile points, measured @max Valsalva, and 3 fixed points at  -- see further below
- management
    + conservative vs. surgical (immediate indicated @procicdentia or total apical eversion)
    + asymptomatic
        * PF PT
        * general advice about lifestyle to decrease risk of presentation
    + symptomatic
        * address other medical issues which may be contributing
        * non pharma
            - PF PT
            - avoid exercises that worsen it
            - pessary (ring, ring with support), inert silicon to offer support. help with UI. SE: UTI, vaginal infections, erosions, discharge. ring can be managed by self. sits just under cervix, excellent for anterior wall/ uterus. not as good @posterior wall.
                + most common is the ring pessary
        * pharma
            - @post-menopausal == local estrogen (eg ovestin cream @low absorption). also help other symptoms of vaginal dryness etc.
            - discuss with onc/ surgeon @past history of Breast Ca
        * surgical
            - either via the vagina OR abdominally. vaginally preferred @primary prolapse
            - cystocele (anterior colporrhapy)
            - rectocele (posterior colporrhapy)
            - uterine prolapse (hysteropexy -- resupporting with mesh/ suture)
            - complications
                + mesh exposure (bladder erosion, vagina wall erosion)


# POP-Q
    9 point grid system, used for classification of severity and nature of prolapse to guide treatment
- measures 9 points in the vagina, hymen is the reference point, measured in cm relativee to the hymen (eg +3 is 3 cm outside the hymen)
    + anything superficial to hymen is positive (imagine a positive force pushing away from the hymen)
    + anything deep to hymen is negative (imagine a sucking negative force)
- there are 6 mobile points relative to the hymen to be measured (taken @valsalva), and 3 measurements to be taken.
- points
    + Aa 
        * the point 3 cm proximal to urethral meatus on full reduction uterus, range relative to hymenal opening (-3 to +3)
    + Ap
        * similar to Aa, but posterior wall, (-3 to +3)
    + Ba
        * 
- measurements
    + GH:
        * genital hiatus: measured from middle of external urethral meatus to the posterior midline hymen
    + TVL:
        * total vaginal length, the greatest depth of the vagina when point C or D is reduced to normal position
    + PB:
        * measured from the posterior margin of teh genital hiatus to the midanal opening
- stages (takes the most distal part of the prolapse @full valsalva)
    + most distal <-1cm from hymen
    + Stage 2: -1 - 1 cm relattive to hymen
    + Stage 3: max descent less than TVL, > 1cm
    + Stage 4: full extrusion = TVL

# Clinical
- vitals: Temp elevated
- face: petechiae in mouth/ face. poor dentition. 
- neck: JVP %elevated
- chest: heart murmur (new). %over TV (IVDU) or MV. %poor air entry @infarct, crepitations @2ndary HF
- hands: -=%(janeway's lesions, osler nodes), splinter hemorrhages, infarcts
- abdomen: pulsatile liver
- legs: infarcts/ splinter hemorrhages/ pitting edema @HF

# Complications
- aortic root abscess

# Investigations
- FBE (aneamia/ WCC)
- UEC (renal function/ IE releated GN, infarcts)
- LFTs (liver infarcts/ comorbid liver disease @drug use)
- blood cultures
- septic screen (rule out other causes of fever @septic screen)
- RF
- TTE
- TOE
    + esp @prosthetic mech valve often require TOE @noise from prosthetic valve
- CT/ MRI brain (rule out cerebral infarcts)

# Duke criteria
- Major criteria
    + Blood cultures +ve typical for organisms of IE
    + Evidence of endocardial involvement
- Minor criteria 
    + predisposing factor (eg IVDU, congenital heart disease, RHD)
    + temp >38
    + vascular phenomenon
    + immunological phenomenon
    + atypical organisms +ve
- @2 major OR 1 major + 3 minor OR 5 minor == definite diagnosis
- @3 minor OR 1 major + 1 minor == possible diagnosis

# Microbiology
- usu GPC (enterococci, staph, strep)
    + viridans strep
    + 11% coag negative staph (more common @prosthetic valve)
    + strep bovis
- staph
    + more likely to disseminate and infect other areas
- culture negative IE (often require PCR to diagnose)
    + coxella burnietti
    + mycoplasma
    + legionella

# Treamtent
- proph
    + many procedures cause transient bacteremia, but not good evidence that reduces the risk of IE. only recommended for high risk procedures. (eg past IE, congneital heart disease, immunosuppressed)
- abx
    + long course of IV Abx 4-6 weeks (PO may not be inferior @recent evidence)
    + options
        * 1st: vancomycin (good @covers ++GPCs)
        * synergy: rifampicin (prosthetic valve)/ low dose gentamicin
- surgery
    + @heart failure complications @fistula/ valve dysfunction
    + often @prosthetic valve
    + heart block
    + aortic abscess (rule out with TOE)
    + drug resistant organisms unable to treat with abx
    + persistent bacteremia despite abx

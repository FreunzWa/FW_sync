###### Use of US for COVID-19 screening POC
- issues @lack of training and lack of non-contaminated materials to perform the US
- could be used to triage COVID cases
- very SN @detect small areas of lung consolidation/ collapse/ pleural effusion/ PTx. usu @posterior basal segments
- use the iLungScan package. and iphone app

# Diagnostic features
- Pneumonia
    + minimal volume loss
    + white dots (bronchial air artefacts)
- Lung collapse
    + substantial volume loss
    + absence of white dots
- Pleural effusion  
    + black space ebetween lung/ diaphragm/ chest wall. 
    + @reflective material in fluid == empyema
    + volume calculated @distance in cm * 200. true volume often 10-12 times higher than this.
- Pneumothorax
    + look for movement at the pleural interface. @no sliding lung == possible PTx
    + lack of lung pulse, seashore sign, may suggest NOT Ptx
- Interstitial syndrome
    + ++number and spread of long laser-like B-lines travel from pleural line to the bottom of thee screen. they are wide lines.
    + may be caused @PF/ PO/ ARDS

# Benefits to US in COVID-19
- low cost, high diagnostic accuracy (correlates well with CT)
- less exposure to radiation
- earlier detection than CXR or symptoms
- useful in monitoring
- more time critical than serology
- can be used to guide management/ followup
- can be used to investigate for alternate diagnoses

# Disadvantages to US in COVID-19
- lack of envidence
- operator dependent

# COVID-19 features
- early findings (precede CXR findings and clinical features)
    + isolated patchy areas of B lines @lung edema/ inflamm
    + irregular thickening of the lung outer edge
    + preserved lung sliding
    + usu bilateral but early stages could be localised
- intermediate findings
    + thickened pleura
    + confluent B lines
- late findings
    + subpleural consolidation (up to 1cm in diameter)
- recovery phase
    + A-lines

# FCU
- focused cardiac ultrasound also useful at baseline and @deterioration to guide haemodynamic treatment @earlier detection of cardiac complications.
- cx include: hypovolaemia/ vasod @sepsis, ventricular dysrhythmia, LV systolic failure

# Preventing contamination/ trasnmission
- larger devices difficult to fully cover. also difficult for liquid decontamination. also @larger == cooler fan == spread
- hand hygiene, consider no ECG, cover machine with plastic sheet, PPE, single gel sachets rather than gel bottle.
- avoid TOE (aerosol generating)
- focussed scan for specific question to limit exposure time. can focus on teh posterior basal segments @majority of findings here. reviewer present outside to complete review asap.
- if possible defer until get NP-PCR results
- N95 mask on patient to protect the operator.
- limit scan length. only use most highly trained.
- sterile sheath:
    + portable US devices eg smartphone. can operate entirely throug h the sheath.
    + can capture images and transfer to pacs
    + butterfly device is used to connect to phone. load the app. plastic sheath placed around the phone
    + must ensure that buttefly probe and smartphone are not contaiminated vital.

###### Thrombocytopaenia
- normal Pt > 150
- can tolerate Pt > 100 @chemotherapy






# General clinical manifestations
- clinical
    + bleeding
        * platelet type bleeding, ++@superficial muco-cutaneous bleeding (nose bleeding, gingival bleeding, abnormal menstrual bleeding, skin bleeding, platelet disorders, mild VWDs)
    + purpura/ petechiae



### DDx
- ITP (immune thrombocytopaenia)
- HIV/ HCV infection (can present with thrombocytopaenia)
- various rheumatological conditions
- hepato/ splenomegaly (sequestration of platelets)
- chemotherapeutic

# ITP (immune thrombocytopaenia)
    diagnsis of exclusion (isolated thrombocytopaenia without anaemia/ leukopaenia without another apparent cause of thrombocytopaenia)
- @autoAb formation against platelet antigens 
- must differentiate from other causes of thrombocytopaenia (differnet mx), primary ITP or secondary to another condition
- time course
    + <3 months: newly diagnosed
    + 3-12 months: persistent
    + 12+months: chronic
- primary vs secondary
    + primary @autoimmune destruction
    + secondary @anther condition (eg HIV, HCV, SLE, CLL, DITP)
        * immunotherapy: pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab, alemtuzumab
        * MMR vaccine
- etiology
    + drug induced ITP
    + HIT
- clinical
    + ++asympatomatic
    + main sx are in relation to bruising/ bleeding
    + %fatigue
    + %petechiae
    + %purpura
- investigations
    + FBE
        * ITP shows thrombocytopaenia
        * usually other cell counts are normal unless 2nd to condition that affects others.
            - %fe microcytic anaemia @blood loss 2nd to ITP
    + coags
        * coagulation profile typically normal
    + cellular microcopsy/ morphology
        * absence of abnormal platelet morphology
- important rule out
    + bone marrow infiltrative conditions
    + vitamin B12/ folate defciicny
- natural history
    + complications
        * bleeding risk in general low, but higher @platelets < 10 (risk of severe bleed v low, but %%GI bleeds severe, esp @prior bleeding an advanced age)
- treatment
    + @severe bleeding + platelets < 30: 
        * immediate platelet transfusion
        * ITP-specific IVIG
        * high dose GCs
        * anti-D immune globulin
    + @high risk bleeding (PUD, use of antiplatelet agents/ anticoagulants)/ high risk lifestyle for bleeding
        * maintain >50

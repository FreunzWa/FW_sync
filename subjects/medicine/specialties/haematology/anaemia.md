###### Anaemia

# Approach
    Decreased production
        Fe deficiency anaemia
            Chronic blood loss
        VitB12 deficiency   
            Pernicious anaemia
    Increased breakdown
        Haemolysis
        Splenomegaly

# Drug induced
- immune hemolysis
    + @cephalosporins/ penicillin
    + %platinum containin chemo/ immunotherapy


-------------------------------------
##### Macrocytic anaemia

# Fetus (pregnancy)

# Alcohol induced
- 


# B12/ Folate deficiency
    both present with macrocytic anaemia with similar presentation
- etiology
    + Pernicious
        * type of VitB12 deficiency anaemia @auto-antibodies attacking parietal cells which usually produce IF which would otherwise bind to VitB12 and allow absorption in the ileum by cells expressing cubilin receptors which bind and uptake the complex. 
    + dietary: 
        * vitb12 @strict vegan
        * folate @poor nutrition intake/ alcohol
- medical
    + ?H. pylori may eb involved in teh pathogenesis of the disease. @chronic infection ?== autoimmunity @molecular mimicry.
    + @poorly matured erythrocytes == cannot develop and are haemolysed early == bilirubin accumulation
- clinical
    + neuropscyhiatric changes
    + GI changes (@VitB12 deficiency == glossitis/ oral ulcers). 
    + %gait/ peripheral paraestehsia. @progressive demyelination ofthe DCML. 
    + mood: depression/ cognitive slowing/ insomnia, irritability, dementia, psychoses.
    + %mild jaundice
- differential
    + folate vs. Vitb12 deficiency 
        * similar presentation
        * diet: vitb12 esp @vegans. Folate only @-=nutrition status/ ++marked etoh
        * time course: vitb12 stores @body large == takes years. folate %develop @weeks
- investigations
    + MCV > 100 (macrocytic anaemia)
    + %mild pancytopaenia
    + low reticulocyte count
    + blood film
        * hypersegmented neutrophils





# Fe Deficiency anaemia
- basics
- medical
    + associations
        * causes of chronic occult bleed (slow variceal bleed/ PUD/ malignancy / angiodysplasia)
        * menorrhagia

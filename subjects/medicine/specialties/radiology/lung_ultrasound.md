###### Lung ultrasound
- Lung US helps with intercostal cathter placement
- LUS more accurate than CXR and almost as good @CT for pleural effusions/ pneumothorax/ interstitial syndrome, consolidation, abscess, emphysema, PE
- LUS better than clinical examination for eg Pleural effusion
- better @treating physician uses it.
- most diagnosis is pattern recognition rather than measurement based == easy to incorporate into practice

# Scanning the lung -- locations
- 3 main scanning zones
    + ANT (ant and lateral surface of upper lope)
    + PU (post. surface @upper lobe and lt surface of anterior lobe)
    + PL (posterior lateral surface of lower lobe)

# Types of probes
- curvilinear OR microconvex good at reaching posterior lung bases (site of most pathology). also has the largest field of view and deeper penetration
- phased array have less pleural resolution
- linear probe not good depth penetration but may resolve superficial pleura better.

# Performing exam
- commence posterior examination on PL zone. hold probe vertically and move inferior until see abdo on RIGHT and lung on the LEFT (may need to rotate probe through 180 degrees). must id the diaphragm. travel inferiorly medially to the scapula
- patient sitting easiest
- ANT zones covered from anterior aspect from superior to inferior pole
- @supine position, posterior rotate patient 45 degrees. as posterior as possible medial to the scapula. 

# Recording results
- important to docuemnt patient position during the examination , presence and location of pleural drains, mech ventilated?, chest wall dressings
- include volume of any pleural effusions


# Normal appearance
- ribs: intercostal space will be seen between two shadows cast by the ribs
- pleural line: hyperechoic, the two surfaces slide 'lung sliding' during respiration 'crawling ants'
- deep to pleural line is all artefact. @normal == grey speckled shadown and changes appearance like TV white noise (Merlin's space). @highly reflective == reverberated below and can see as A-lines. 
- Z-lines are perpendicular to the pleural line 'comet-tail' artifacts

# M-mode ultrasound in LUS
- M-mode displays motion of single point over time, illustrate changes in 2D US appaereance @movement @respiration. allows easier to see sliding.
- enables easier visualisation of sliding
- seashore sign

# Diagnosing lung pathologies
- PTx
    + best to use a high frequency probe @only looking superficial. can also use Mmode to help
    + inability to see lung sliding @middlie ANT zone in supine patient or supper upper ANT zone @erect patient. however some PTx limited @adhesions so examine every interspace.
        * must distinguish @PF/ adhesions/ bullous disease/ severe atelectasis/ consolidation which can also cause -=lung sliding
    + Exclude @: B-lines/ lung sliding in the imaged area, lung pulse (heart oscillates lungs -- can use M-mode as well for pulse)
    + ~100% PPV: lung point (point where part of pleura lung sliding and part adjacent no sliding). the lung point moves with respiration @PTx migrates @repisration. may be hard to find @very large PTx

# Pleural effusion
- anechoic area between parietal and visceral pleura. 
- roughly as accurate as CT for effusions
- @presence of echogenic material == complex fluids that could be haematoma, empyema (esp @plankton sign with particular matter), jellyfish sign (collapsed lung edge @atelectactic lung moving with an associated effusion flapping around 

# Lung consolidation/ atelectasis/ infarction/ contusion
- all cause localised grey tissue appaerance
- differneitating:
    + consolidation: subpleural echo poor region 'hepatisation' @++conduction due to fluid content. minimal volume loss. mobile air bronchograms may be present.
    + atelectasis: homogenous tissue w/ signiifnat loss of lung volume (see P effusions)
        * often occurring w/ consolidation
        * lung volume loss (unlike consolidation)
        * static air bronchograms
    + abscess (consolidation w/ cavitation)
        * anechoic cvavitation with irregular septae/ opacifications. complex @filled @fibrinous/ necrotic material.
    + PE (peripherally placed wedge shaped consolidation)
        * esp consider @criticially unwell paitent cannot transport to CT
        * visualising the infarction. @perioheral == mutiple small triangular pleural based consolidations.
        * combine with cardiac ultrasound for features of right heart strain

# Interstitial syndrome
- appearance @pulmonary edema/ interstitial pneumonia/ pneumonitis/ ARDS/ PF
- key diagnostic feature of IS is 3+ B-lines in a lung inerspace.
    + B-lines are radial obscure A-lines and all way to bottom of image
- focal IS possible @closure atelectasis @supine in bed OR at pneumonia, contusion, infarction
- to diagnose Pulmonary edema == B-pattern in both lungs. 'white lun' @confluence of B-lines which is present @severe APO

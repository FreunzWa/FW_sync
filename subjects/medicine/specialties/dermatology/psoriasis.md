###### Psoriasis

# Epidemiology
- 3% of population
- M = F
- 2 peaks of onset (20s and late 50s)
- assoc with Chron's disease
- family history

# Medical
- mx
    + hyperproliferation (4-7 day period of proliferation, usually takes 28 days. thus basal cells at the surface which are non keratinised and very fragile, bleed, scaling)
        * the basal cells are less flattened and so the lesion presents as a plaque
    + eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate
    + vascular proliferation

# Classification
- chronic plaque
    + red raised symmetrical extensor surfaces
    + sometimes no scale @apposition between skin surfaces like the breasts and thighs.
    + 'salmon pink' appearance
- pustular psoriasis
    + sterile pustules on soles of feet
    + higher risk @smoker/ female
- guttate psoriasis
    + may be associated with antecedent history of strep infection
    + younger age group
    + usually self resolving, can reassure
- erythrodermic psoriasis
    + more than 90% of skin surface very erythematous == ++%of CO going to the skin == can cause end organ hypoperfusion/ dehydration/ reduce temperature. 
    + may require urgent managemnet
- nail psoriasis
    + onycholysis, yellowing stain, pitting, affecting surrounding skin
    + may be associated with psoriatic arhtritis

# Treatment
- pharmacalogical
    + topical treatments
        * topical steroids (treat flares, do not treat underlying problem)
        * vit D analogues (if large SA, then worry about too much absorption)
        * retinoids
        * immunomodulators
        * coal tar (limited @inconvenient patients)
    + systemic treatments (requires referral, usu @systemic)
        * UV treatment
        * systemic immunomodulation
    + oral steroids are not advised!
        * they can cause resolution of short term symptoms. however after they are ceased they cause a severe flare up, there are better treatments available.

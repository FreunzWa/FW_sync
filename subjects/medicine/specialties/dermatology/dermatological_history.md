###### Dermatological history

# General principles
Red flags in dermatological history
 - pain, bleeding, ulceration, itch
Specifically ask for involvement of other sites.
Have you ever tried any treatments
- self medication may partially treat/ modify the condition
Occupational history
- exposure to new substances
Medications
- must be very comprehensive

# Rash history

# Lesion
- cardinals
    + size/ location/ color/ symmetry/ shape
- time course
    + change over time, fluctuation? normal in between abnormal periods. 
- associated features
    + itch/ pain/ ulceration/ bleeding
- history
    + skin phototype
    + sun exposure history (going back to childhood, esp hobbies, solarium use, sunbaking history)
    + sunburn history (blistering sun burns)
    + Hair color in the 20s, eye color
    + Where did you grow up (eg Qld > risk @Tasmania)
    + PHx of lesions/ skin cancers

# Basic morphology of lesions
- pustules on highly keratinized acral surfaces appear differently @thick stratum corneum does not allow typical elevation of the skin. (may appear as a hypo/hyper-pigmented macule)
- excoriations are linear, erosions. both superficial dermis
- ulceration and fissures involve the dermis. potential for scarring. 
- pattern:
    + scattered/ group/ dermatomal
    + confluent 
    + symmetrical
    + extensor/ flexor
    + sites affected (hair bearing, sebaceous, mucosal surfaces)
    + exogenous (sun exposed - photosensitive eruption, contact history)
    + spread of the lesion
- surface
    + lichenification (see exaggerated skin lines, usu @response to getting rubbed, esp @eczema)
    + crusting
    + scaling
- edges
    + well-define/ poorly defined

###### Title
- terms
    + mohs surgery
        * progressive removal of tissue examining for tumor cells. is the definitive method for attaining complete margin control

-----------------------------------------------
### Melanoma
    Acral lentiginous melanoma
    Lentigo maligna melanoma
    Superficial spreading melanoma
    Nodular melanoma
    Amelanotic melanoma

# Acral lentiginous melanoma
- basics
    + occurs on palms/ soles or under nails. 


# Lentigo maligna melanoma
- basics
    + esp @chronically sun damaged areas in the elderly


# Superficial spreading melanoma 


# Nodular melanoma
- basics
    + most aggressive/ invasive @++metastatic potential @vertical growth == ++passage through basement membrane

# Amelanotic melanoma
- basics
    + nodule/ macule/ patch containing no melanin.

# Staging
- breslow depth is absolute measure of how far melanoma has invaded. important @prognostic staging.
    + thickness of melanoma measured in mm. 
        * <1 mm is epidermis
        * 1-4 is in the dermis
        * @>4 is in the hypodermis
- Clark staging
    + 5 levels @what tissue the melanoma has invaded into

----------------------------------------

### Squamous cell carcinoma
    Keratoacanthoma
    Bowen's disease (SCC in situ)
    Invasive SCC
    Marjolin's ulcer

# Squamous cell carcinoma
- basics   
    + can develop on any cutaneous surface, including oral mucosa, anogenital areas. ++@sites exposed to the sun. 55%head and neck location. 
    + @dark skin, more common on non sun exposed sites, esp areas of chronic inflammation/ carring. 
    + anogenital lesions are rare, usu related to HPV infection. 
    + tumors on the ear, mucocutaneous surfaces, preauricular surfaces tend to be more aggressive with higher met rates 10-30%
- clinical
    + appearance
    + dermoscopy
        * 1. central keratin mass (yellow-white areas)
        * 2. targetoid hair follicles
        * 3. ulceration (structureless irregular dull red-brown color)
        * 4. vascular structures: linear-irregular vessels, hairpin vessels. %dotted/ glomerular vessels (or in combination == polymorphous)
        * if the SCC is poorly differentiated == ++bleeding/ vascularity == very red. 
    

# Actinic keratosis
- basics
- types
    + nonpigmented
    + pigmented
- clinical
    + dermoscopy
        * 1. erythema, structureless pale-red areas
        * 2. pink-red pseudonetwork. resemble a network @hypopigmented areas corresponding to follicular openings on the skin
        * 3. fine, way vessels. (straight/ coiled) surroudning hair follicles
        * 4. targetoid hair follicles (keratotic plug)

# Bowen's disease
- basics
    + SCC in situ. early form of invasive SCC
- types
    + pigmented. more common in darker skin.
    + non pigmented
    + Erythroplasia of Queyrat (SCC in situ involving the penis)
- clinical
    + appearance
        * well demarcated scaly patch or plaque. lesions are erythematous but %skin color/ pigmented. Bowen's disease grows slowly. 
    + dermoscopy
        * vascular patterns
            - 1. clustered vascular pattern (focal clustered, asymmetric vessels)
            - 2. glomerular (coiled) vessels, torturous capillaries larged than dotted vessels. (each looks like a small glomerulus in the kindey)
            - 3. hyperkeratotic surface
    + presentation  
        * usu asymptomatic
 
# Marjolin's ulcer
- basics
    + SCC arising @chronic wounds, with high latency of progression to malignant. 
    + usu starts as ulceration that fails to heal. eg after burn 
    + in general SCCs @wounds are more aggressive and associated with poorer prognosis. 

# Keratoacanthoma
- basics
    + common low grade but rapidly growing skin tumor
    + there is controversy abt whether this is a true variant of SCC, and whether it is malignant. regardless, most advocate for the treatment of KA through excision.
    + cannot be distinguished clinically 100% from SCC
    + if KA, then there is a chance for spontaneous resolution
- types 
    + keratoacanthoma centrifugum marginatum
    + single keratoacanthoma
    + multiple keratoacanthoma
    + subungual keratoacanthoma
- medical
    + arise from hair follicle (pilosebaceous unit). well differentiated.
    + prognosis
        * %self resolve through involution. true KA will resolve, but KA can have SCC in it. 
        * %%%metastasis, exceedingly rare, probably SCC actually, misdiagnosis. 
- rx
    + total excision is indicated, unless pt preference
        * Conventional surgical excision. as there is difficulty distinguishing from SCC, should do at least 4mm margins which is standard for SCC.
        * Mohs surgeyr only used if there is a need for tissue preservation, as it is more expensive. 
    + should not do punch @may miss the SCC margins.
    + in cases where excision is not desired by the patient, advocate observation to check for spontaneous resolution.
        * should take photographs of the lesion every 2-3 weeks. 
        * of course patient should be informed of treametnet options.
    + there are alternative therapies to destroy it (radiation, topicals, electrodesiccation) however these do not provide diagnosis confirmation.
    + for patients with multiple keratoacanthoma OR keratoacanthoma centrifugum marginatum, recommend systemic therapy with retinoids. 
- clinical
    + appearance
        * erupts in sun damaged skin. 
        * dome shaped symmetrical surrounded by smooth wall of inflamed skin
        * capped with keratin scale/ debris



------------------------------------

# Basal cell carcinoma
- locally invasive skin cancer ++requiring treatment @early treatment reduces the risk of recurrence
- natural history
    + complications
        * advanced BCC  
            - ++@neglected tumors. may be impossible to treat surgically.
        * metastatic BCC
            - %%%. v rare
        * recurrence
            - BCC may recur locally, rf for this are:
                + @>10mm diam in M areas (thus head/ neck more likely to recur)
                + @>20mm diam in L areas
                + perineural invaasion
                + nodular/ superficial histo pattern
                + already recurred
                + poorly defined clinial borders
                + immunosuppressed
                + hx of radiation therapy at the site
                + morphoeic/ micronodular/ infiltrative subtypes
- types
    + superficial BCC (macular lesion, often after trauma/ burn erythema region that doesnt resolve)
    + nodular BCC (the one with pearly ages)
    + sclerosing morphoiec basal cell carcinoma
- treatment
    + ++recommend surgical excision

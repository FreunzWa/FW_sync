###### Esophageal pathology


--------------------------------

# Esophageal diverticuli
    true diverticula: contain all layers
    false: contain only mucosa/ submucssoa
    intramural: confined to only the submucosa
    classified based upon location in the Esophagus
- Zenkers diverticulum
    + false diverticulum neear the upper esophageal sphincter
- Traction diverticulum
    + near the midpoint of the esophagus 
- Epiphrenic diverticulum
    + just above the esophageal sphincter


# Zenker's diverticulum
- sac like outpouching of mucosa/ submucosa through @natural area of weakness @ Killians triangle (precisely posterior to cricoid cartilage, weakening between the thyropharyngeus and the cricopharyngeus). %no Killians triangle (more prevalent in males)
- presentation
    + ++%asymptomatic
    + more symptomatic in males.
    + regurgitation of undigested food debris
    + %transient dysphagia
    + @large == halitosis, throat gurgling, appearance of mass in the neck, regurgitation of food into the mouth. 
    + @longstanding dysphagia == %weight loss/ malnourishment
    + @++Severe == %obstruction of the esophagus
- natural histoyr
    + complications
        * aspiration pneumonia
        * ulceration/ bleeding @retained medication
        * fistula
        * vocal cord paralysis @retained food
- investigations
    + barium swallow examination
    + upper endocscopy to rule out intercurrent malignancy
- treat
    + usu only treat @>1cm + symptomatic
    + surgical: either transoral endoscopy/ open surgeries

----------------

# Esophageal strictures
- etiology (simple vs. complex strictures)
    + Simple: 75%@long standing GERD (aka peptic strictures)
    + Complex: 25%@radiation/ esophageal sclerotherapy, caustic ingestions, surgical anastomosis, rare mucous dermatological diseases (these non GERD causes are typically harder to treat), eosinophilic esophagitis 
- clinical
    + presentation  
        * progressive dysphagia
- Investigation
    + %barium swallow esp @complex strictures
    + endoscopy -- diagnostic, @suspicion for a malignant cause.  biopsy. recommended @done after the dilation @greater risk of perforation.
- treatment
    + dilation
        * mechanical dilation
        * balloon dilation
    + ongoing PPI

-------------
# Inflammatory esophageal conditions

# Medication-induced esophagitis
- etiology
    + Abx: tetracycline, doxycycline, clindamycin
    + Aspirin other anti-inflammatories %can cause esophagitis/ strictures
    + Bisphophonates: but risk low
- risk  
    + pill without water just before bedtime
- clincial
    + retrostenral pain/ heartburn
    + odynophagia
    + dysphagia
    + %haematemesis



# Eosinophilic esophagitis
    chronic immune/antigen mediated disease w/ symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction
- classification
    + 3 histological subtypes, (1/2/3), in increasing severity.
- etiology
    + associate dwith other atopic conditions (esp asthma, food allergies, environment allergies, atopic dermatitis)
- diagnosis
    + symptoms related to EoE
    + eosinophil predominant inflammation @esophegal biopsy
    + exclusion oter causes that cause eosinophila in the esophagus
        * (GERD, achalasia, infections, hypereosinophilic syndrome, eosinophilic gastritis, pemphigus)
- natural history
    + complciations
        * strictures 
- presentation
    + dysphagia
    + %food impactions
    + %chest pain centrally located, may not respond to antacids
    + GERD
    + upper abdominal pain
    + odynophagia
- investigations
    + endoscopy
        * stacked circular rings (feline esophagus)
        * strictures (esp proximal)
        * attenuation 
        * linear furrows
        * whitish papules
        * small caliber esophagus
    + biopsy
        * distal and proximal esophagus biopsy
    + allergy assessment
- treatment
    + topical GCs (budesonide/ fluticasone)
    + systemic GCs not usu feasible, only @severe disease refractory to topical treatment
    + esophageal dilation @stricture formaton %perfroation == (multiple dilations over different session required)

-----------------------------------
# Esophageal achalasia
- etiology
    + @progressive degeneration of ganglion cells @myenteric plexus @esophageal wall == failure of LES to relax == loss of distal esophagus peristalsis    
    + ddx
        * @chagas
        * sarcoid, amyloidosis, NF, juvenile sjogrens syndrome, chronic idiopathic intenstinal pseudo-obstruction, fabry disease
        * %HLA-DQ associations/ autoimmune etiology/ @viral trigger
- natural history
    + prognosis
        * marked dilatation
        * increased risk of cancer
- clinical features
    + dysphagia for solids/ liquid
    + regurgiations of retained matreail esp @recumbent
    + %self induce vomiting @feeling of retrosternal fullness after a meal
    + substernal chest pain/ heart burn (unresponsive to PPI's)
    + %hiccups
- investigaitons
    + CXR: %widening of the mediastinum @dilation of the esophagus
    + barium swallow: aperistalsis in the distal 2/3 of the esophagus. %dilation of the esophagsu (megaesophagus), narrow esophagastric junction (@persistenyl contracted LES), delayed empyting of barium
    + fine needle aspiration @GEJ to rule out malignancy
    + esophageal manometry tfor distringuishing EA from other motility disorders
- other differentials
    + GEJ malignancy (pseudoachalsia @invasion into nerve plexus)
    + GERD (however the regurgitated foor is usu sour @gastric acid present)
    + other motility disorders (esophageal spasm/ jackhammer esophagus)
- treatment
    + surgical
        * peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) (weaken LES by cutting muscle fibres) - 'Heller procedure'
        * pneumatic dilation (weakens the LES to allow food to passage)
        * laparoscopic heller myotomy with partial fundoplication
    + pharmacological
        * botox
        * oral nitrates

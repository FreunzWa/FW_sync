###### Liver disease

# Clinical
- examination
    + jaundice
    + coagulopathy
        * 
    + portal venous hypertension
        * varices
        * caput medusae
        * splenomegaly
    + %hepatomegaly/ liver atrophy @advanced disease




# Complications of CLD/ cirrhosis
- variceal hemorrhage
- HCC
- spontaneous bacterial peritonitis @ascites
- ascites
- hepatopulmonary syndrome
- hepatorenal syndrome

# Portal esophageal varices
- high risk @severe upper GI bleed %fatal
- monitoring
    + gastroscope: @mild ==> follow up in 2 years
- rx
    + intervention
        * prophylactic banding
    + pharmacological
        * propranolol (++@Europe), but poorly tolerated

# Decompensated liver failure
- ascites
- hepatic encephalopathy


# Hepatic encephalopathy
- decline in conscious state, intellectual function, increasingly aggressive, neuromuscular abnormalities (tremor, ataxia, coma) @urea accumulation (severity @presentation graded 1-4)
- rx
    + acute 
        * lactulose/ lactilol
            - ==acidic environment in stomach == sequestration of NH3 (@-=Nh4) == less precursors for the production of protein == less Urea produced @byproduct
        * reverse underlying cause
    + prophylaxis
        * rifaximin (long term)
            - reduction in microflora that produce ammonia 
        * protein restriction diet

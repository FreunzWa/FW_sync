##### Hepatitis B

# Screening
- perform HBsAg and anti-HBs
    + @asymptomatic individuals
- perform anti-HBc IgG
    + @HIV
    + @HCV who are going to undergo treatment with antivirals
    + @require immunosuppressive therapy
    + @blood/ organ donors 

# Serology interpretation
- HBsAg
    + HBV infection, appears 1-10 weeks after exposure.
    + @pt who recover/ elevation of ALT == undetectable HBsAg in 4-6 months.
    + @>6 months == chronic HBV infection
    + usu disappearance followed by rise in hbsab
- HBsAb
- HBcAb
    + HBcore antigen is not detectable @intracellular antigen
    + HBc either IgM or IgG.
        * the IgM is often the only marker for infection in between disappearnce of sAg and sAb
        * IgM %can be elevated up to 2 yrs post initial HBV infection
    + IgG anti-HBc will persist along with sAb in patients who recover from acute infection
- E antigen
    + secretory protein that marks HBV replication/ infectivity. assoc with high levels of HBV DNA in serum
    + seroconversion from e antigen to antibody usually occurs early @acute infection, prior to the s antigen-ab seroconversion. 
    + seroconversion usu associated with reduction in HBV DNA and remission of liver disease.
- HBV DNA
    + major role in testing is to assess for antivaral therapy
    + @high HBV DNA and active liver disease == can consider starting antiviral therapy.



# Treatments
- antivirals
    + Entecavir
        * used to treat chronic HBV infection with evidence of active viral replication/persistent elevation in serum AST/ALT
        * achieves seroconversion in 20% of patients with HBeAg positive HBV
        * very low ~1% levels of viral resistance
        *

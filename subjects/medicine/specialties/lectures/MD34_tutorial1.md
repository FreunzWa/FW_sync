Psych history basics
--------------------

usually aim to establsh rapport with the patient at first, name, age, do on a day to day basis. however in an OSCE bit more impersonal.

Presenting Complaint
- developmental history (mum's health during pregnancy,  postpartum depression?, childhood questions, what was it like in teh home when you were young, siblings)
- standard cardinal features of the presenting comlpiant, have you seen psych, any treaemtens for it. 
- any insight into their illness? could signify psychosi, delusional disorder
- impact on the patient's life (what are you able to do, do you still enjoy doing the same activities)
- Risk  
    + suicidal ideation
        + have you ever thought of harming yourself
        + have you ever made a plan
        + have you ever acted on this plan
        + passive vs. active suicidal ideation (suicide attempts vs. just not wanting to wake up)

    + mum's health during pregnancy,  postpartum depression?, childhood questions, what was it like in teh home when you were young, siblings

Developmental history
- birth to older age

=========================================================

Hallucination - perceiving something that isnt there (either visually or auditory, all other senses but they are much more unlikely)
Delusion
- a fixed unshakeable belief in something that isnt true delusion, hallucination
- primary delusion
- secondary delusion (can arise from another)

==========================================================
Elements of a MSE 
- Appearance
    + objective description, helping someone to pick out someone out of the waiting room. comment on clothing. grooming. 
- Behaviour
    + Movement: gesticulation, gait disturbance, manic, fidgeting. 
    + Eye contact: avoiding/ maintaining/ too much
    + Engagement: non-engaging/ engaging
- Speech
    + Route taken: direct response to question/ tangential in response? 
    + Amount/ Speed
    + Prosity/ Volume 
    + flight of ideas
- Mood
    + mood is exactly what the patient describes to be:
    + "the person reports their mood to be:"
    + euthymic == happy
- Affect
    + What you perceive the patient to be feeling
    + may be congruent vs. incongruent
        * relationship between affect and the subject matter.
    + quality (dysthymic, euthymic, euphoric)
    + Flat, Blunted (implying psychosis/ schizophrenia), Labile/ Hyperreactive (BPAD), Fatuous (not present in teh conversation/ vacant/ silly/ superficial), Perplexity (bewildered by everything)
    + Quality/Reactivity/ Range/ Congruence
    + 'communication of affect' - if the patients affect changes your mood
- Thought form
    + how they formulate and orgnaise their thoughts. 
    + either tangential
    + derailment (illogical jump to another topic)
    + cirumstantial (over-inclusion of ideas - go off on other topics but come back to the point)
    + 'word salad' - random disconnected words as a result of a psychotic condition, psychotic depression
    + latency: (delay between getting asked a question)
    + blocking: stop talking mid-sentence. 
- Thought content
    + 'meaning of the words' - summarise what the patient has told you. eg thought content was consisted of grandiose ideas about taking over the world and establishing a new race on the moon, or the patients thought content was consistent with suicidal ideation
- Perception
    + presence of hallucinations? (often people lie about their hallucinations)
    + responding to internal stimuli? 
    + 'no perceptual disturbances were elicited'
- Cognition
    + "Grossly intact and oriented to time person and place"
    + Can also then follow up with standardized testing (RUDAS/ SMMSE)
    + Attention, Praxis, recall
- Insight'
    + Does patient think anything wrong with them (do they think symptoms are normal?)
    + Does patient think they have psych disorder (do they think their diagnosis is real?)
    + Does patient think that they will benefit from treatment?
- Judgement
    + how well can person make a balanced apprasial of their circumstnaces (would the person be able to cross the road and take the approrpriate precautions.)
- Risks
    + risks to self
        * self harm/ suicide
        * neglect/ misadventure/ gambling
    + risks to others
        * deliberate
            - aggression, assault, homicide
        * unintentional
            - neglecting, driving while manic, leaving a fire on causing 
            - manslaughter

# Delirium
- acute potentially reversible fluctuating mental status change
- can persist for months beyond intiail stimulus
- causes cognitive impairemtn which persists, een in the absence of neurodegenerative disease (the worse the delirium == the worse the subseent CI will be)
- severity is asscoatied with cognitivite impairment
- accelerates onset of AD by about 3x
- causes:
    + any stressor in the setting of cognitive decline


various delirium pathogenesis theories
- network connectivity (thought to be @dysfunction of interdigitating networks, eg @trauma, vascular events, tumor)
    + aims to account for the 'reserve capacity' that some people seem to have in resistance to delirium 
- nt theory,
- inflammation and oxidative stress (thought to be @depletion in oxygen and energy stores == excitotoxictiy)
- HPA axis (stress plays a role)


treatment: 
- BZDs make things worse (@worse executive function), also confusion is worse
- Antipsyhotics have a very mild impact on symptoms




similarities between psychoses and delirium
- hallucinations (delirium is more visual, psychoses are more auditory)

delirium and not in psychoses:
- delirium is more fluctuating
- EEG is very useful for differentiating between.
    + EEG could also show non convulsive status seizures

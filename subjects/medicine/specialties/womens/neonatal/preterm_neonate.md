###### Pre-term neonate
    preterm < 37 weeks, 9% of babies
    term is 37-42 weeks
    post-dates is >42 weeks
- classifications of pre-term severity 
    + by weight     
        * low birth weight (<2500 g)
        * very low birth weight (<1500 g)
        * extremely low weight (<1000 g)
    + by GA
        * prematurity (<37 weeks GA)
        * Late preterm (34-36 weeks GA)
        * very premature (<32 weeks)
        * extremely premature (<25 weeks)
- clinical
    + features
        * skin: thin, <27 weeks == dark red (normally thicker and desquamating @term)
        * lanugo: fine hair (normally cleared @term)
        * decreased plantar creases (usu start appearing @34 weeks)
        * @severe preterm == areola absent/ nipple barely visible. (normal appear @34 weeks)
        * eyes/ ears: ears -=cartilage == easy deformation. eyelids fused until 25 weeks.
        * genitalia: female, labia majora not prominent (more prominent clitoris and minora). male, testis descend at 29 weeks
    + neurological features:
        * hypotonia @preterm. very early preterm == defelexed/ extended posture of limbs. at 32 weeks lower limbs flexed.
        * pupils responsive from 29 weeks
        * absence of suckling reflex until 28-29 weeks
        * glabellar tap from 32 weeks
        * flex arms/ neck when pulled by wrists from supine from 34 weeks
- assessment
    + can use Dubowitz/ ballard assessment, which use physical/ neurological assessment to determine degree of prematurity. (+/- 2 weeks accuracy)
        * Ballard physical criteria (skin, lanugo, plantar ssurface, breast, eye and ear, genitals), neuromuscular criteria (posture, square window, arm recoil, popliteal angle, scarf angle, heel to ear)
- management
    + resus offered from GA of 25 weeks. %offered 24/24+6. difficult @23/23+6 (@clinical judgement) -- 22 weeks in Japan %resus.
    + resus/ incubation
        * oxygen: aim for sats 91-95
            - too high == ++ROS and vasoconstriction causing anaerobic glycolysis == ROP (retinopathy of prematurity and cerebral ischaemia) 
            - oxygen supplementation ladder: 
            - too low == chronic ischaemia and growth restriction
        * temperature (issue @thin skin and SA/V ratio)
            - overhead heat lamps, cotton head hat, incubation aiming for 36.5-37.5 celsius. 
        * feeding
            - with breast milk expressed from mother if possible
    + 60% of 24 weeks survive to discharge. 31-32 weeks similar to at-term newborns
    + antenatal corticosteroids can improve lung maturity when thought that preterm birth is imminnent, 48 hours before delivery
    + monitored with BSLs @prterms have low subcut stores of fat == deficient energy supply == ++%hypoglycaemia
    + exogenous lung surfactant, delivered as an aerosol
    + baby continued to be monitored until maturity
- medical problems of prematurity
    + RDS (resp distress sydnrome) @-=pulmonary surfactant. ++assoc with CLD esp @24/24+6 
    + hyoglycaemia: glycogen usu accumulates in last 2 months, may be deficient @preterm == malnourish. take regular BSLs, <2.5 cutoff. @profound hypoglycaemia, commence 10% dextrose
    + jaundice: @less mature conjugation mx (Alb -= ability to bind bili, BBB permeable == bili enters == kernicterus)
    + thermoregulation, @permeable skin and large SA and -=SC fat. @<2000g == nursed in incubator
    + retinopathy (ROP) - aka retrolental fibroplasia. @high pO2 == vasoc and ischamic damage. 
    + intraventricular hemorrhage: @immature brain/ still maturing == hemorrhage @blood pressure fluctuations. @severe == risk of cerebral palsy/ obstructive hydrocephalus.
    + apnoea: cessation of breathing > 20 seconds. assoc with low preterm age and bradycardia. caffeine can help @mild. @severe == ventilatory support
    + necrotising enterocolitis: esp @<1500 g extremely low BW, 6.5% @<28 weeks. @hypotension and hut hypoxia. p/w bloody stool/ distention, apnoea. non specific. surgery often indicated esp @perf
    + PDA: common @preterm. may cause LVF @pumps to both systemic and pulmonary vasculature (much of it diverted to pulmonary vasc @shunting == cardiogenic shock). p/w usu day 4/7 with murmur and resp distress post RDS. surgery usu not needed. NSAID indomethacin == -=PGE2 == -=PGF2 formation == constriction quickened. 
- prognosis
    + ++Risk of neurodevelopmental outcomes (1500-2500g 6-8% of severe disability), bad cognitive outcomes
- continuing management
    + may have issues with feeding, oxygen dependence, surgical issues, neruodevelopmental issues
    + esp @<1500g, require multidisciplinary followup
        * PT to assess motor function
        * neuropsych to assess cognitive development
        * audiologist to assess hearing
        * opthal
        * developmental pediatrician

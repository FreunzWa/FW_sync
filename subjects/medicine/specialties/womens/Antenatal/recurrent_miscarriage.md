###### Recurrent miscarriage (RPL)
    aka habitual miscarriage
    defined @3+ CONSECUTIVE miscarriages. 
    1-2% of couples. 
    ++idiopathic, no cause to be found.
    even @3 successive MCs, successful birth @70% of women
    APS is a very important treatable cause
[RPL; recurrent pregnancy loss]


# Classification
- primary RPL
    + never had successful birth
- secondary RPL
    + 3 CONSECUTIVE miscarriages after a successful birth

# Risk facttors
- advancing maternal age
- presence of causes (as below)
- previous MCs


# Causes of recurrent 1T MC
- 40%Thrombophilia
    + Factor V leiden
    + APS
- uterine malformation 
    + acquired (asherman's syndrome)
    + congenital (mullerian)
- endocrine
- chromosomal abnormalities
    + ask if the fetal heart was ever detected. if not detected beefore MC then increeasees the risk tthat t is a chromosomal abnormalitiy
    + ask for consanguity
- exposure to environmental toxins
- DM
- SLE
- thyroid 

# Causes of recurrent 2T MC
- 40%Thrombophilia
    + Factor V leiden
    + APS
- cervical insufficiency
    + maternal ED syndrome
    + previous trauma or procedure eg cone biopsy from the cervix OR cervical laceration during childbirth

 
# Assessment
    important not to investigate women after single FT or early ST MC @these are common sporadic eventts. 1/3 of pregnancies end in MC

- I
    + imaging of uterus (anatomical abnormalities)
        * mullerian abnormalities
        * cervical shortening
    + thrombophilia screening
    + parental karyotyping
    + thyroid functtion testing
    
# Thrombophilia and RPL
- mx
    + pregnancy is already a hypercoagulable state == @addtiional thrombophilia == hypercoagulable state == thrombosis at site of implantation/ placental vessels. 
    + prengnayc has ++vWF, F8, F7, fibrinogen, prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 and d-dimer
- rx
    + anticoagulants 
        * APS: unfractionated lmwh == reduction of pregnancy loss

# APS
- anti-cardiolipin antibioides and lupus anticoagulant

# Karotyping
    done to detect any balanced robertsoniann translocations that couldbe passed to the fetus unbalanced. test both partners
    low yield @mostly normal, only done @exhausted all investigations.


# Imaging for uterine abnormalities
    recommend sonohysterography or hysteroscopy if required.
- looking for congenital mullerian abnormalities (unicornuate, septate, bicornuate) of the uterus OR acquired uterine syndorme likes AS (esp in context of a past history of instrumentation)
- TVUS may also be used


# Thyroid function
    esp @clinical manifestations of thyrroid diseas or past history
    may also do for screening
- both subclinical hypothyroidism and clinical hypothyroidism can cause increased risk of miscarriage
- screen with TSH and TPO levels %@asymptomatic women

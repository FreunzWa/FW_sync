###### Cancer epidemiology


# Tobacco
- tobacco most important carcinogen, and largest cause of preventable death
- 15% of all cancers worldwide, >30% male cancers
- ++cause of lung cancers, most common cancer death, 90% caused @smoker
- also other cancers implicated:
    + mesothelioma
    + myeloid leukaemia
    + GI tract cancers
    + ENT cancers
    + urinary tract cancers
    + liver cancer
    + cervical cancer

# Alcohol
- related to cancers:
    + head and neck cancer
    + oropharynx cancer
    + esophageal cancer (squamous)
    + HCC
    + breast cancer (2-10% of BC are related to etoh)
- possible synergistic with smoking but difficult to determine relative contribution @use highly associated with eachother

# Diet
- obesity associated with:
    + endometrial cncer
    + post menopausal breast cancer
    + renal ca
    + esophageal ca
    + CRC
- @high red meat consumption == appear to increase risk of CRC cancer
- salt fish == nasopharyngeal cancer
- aflatoxin (esp @peanuts, soybeans, corn) == ++HCC

# Exercise
- reduced Exercise == higher risk of many ault tumors (esp colonic and breast cncaers)
- improved outcomes even after diagnosis (esp in breast cancer)


# Infections
- 16% of cancer @infections (higher in developing)
- viral infections
    + HPV
    + HBV/ HCV
    + EBV (higher risk of HL, up to 60%, and Burkitts lymphoma)
- bacterial infections
    + h pylori (higher risk of gastric adenocarcinoma, gastric lymphoma)

# Exposure
- solar
    + 90% of malignant melanoma @sun exposure
    + white australians have highest rate of melanoma in the world
    + sun exposure @childhood especially
    + SCC/ BCC are more associated with cumulative sun exposure
    + melanoma more @intensely exposed
- radiation
    + esp @acute leukaemias/ thyroid cancer
    + possible 1-3% of cancers arising from natural exposure to bg radiation @3% of people show ++SN to radiation
- benzene
    + heam malignancies
- naphythylamines
    + bladder cancer
- asbestos 
    + mesothelioma

# Pharmacological exposure
- many drugs used to treat cancer are carcinogenic

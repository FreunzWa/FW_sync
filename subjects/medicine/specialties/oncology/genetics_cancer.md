###### Genetics of cancer

# Types of genes involved in cancer
- tumour suppressor genes
    + function lost @carcinogenesis process.
    + usu recessive @loss of function mutation @both alleles must be eliminated
    + ==loss of growth inhibition
    + eg p53
        * p53 promotes genomic integrity and cell cycle control
        * 50% of cancers have p53 mutations.
- proto-oncogenes
    + genes enhanced/ activated @carcinogenesis
    + gain of function == dominant expression at cellular level
    + 
- DNA repair genes
    + normal fx carry out DNA repair.
    + @mut == ++accumulation of tumor suppressor genes and proto oncogenic mutations


# Genetic cancer sydnromes
- LFS
    + germline mutation of TP53 == AD ++lifetime risk of cancers




# Tumor suppressor genes
- TP53
- CHK2
    + regulates action of p53
- RB1
- APC
    + mutation == familial adenomatous polyposis

# Proto-oncogenes
- Ras
    + encodes a GPCR == cellular signal transduction
    + mutated Ras products activated even @absence appropriate growth factor receptor signal
    + mutations Ras 30% of all cancers
- BRCA

# DNA repair genes
- ATM
    + activates CHK2 @DNA damage
- BLM gene
    + encodes DNA helicase == lack 3'-->5' helicase activity

Geoff is a 65 year old male currently on his 4th week of a mental health act, institutionalised for delusional disorder and BPAD. He is adequately groomed with spikey gelled hair and wears large blue glasses, looks roughly his age. He is clothes are dirty - he is dressed with a casual t-shirt and shorts, and wears thongs. His behaviour is characterised as being over-familiar, but does not have agitated symptoms. He suffers from delusional thinking, believing he can "summon 1500 men, including syrians" to get him out, and suffers from anosagnosia, he believes that he does not suffer from mental illness and that he is being held against his will. He has gradiose thinking, considering his own abilities very highly, including artistic ones. His thought is characterised by flight of ideas, and is often tangential. He has limited judgement due to poor insight. His cognition is grossly intact, and he is oriented to person time and place.  He does not appear to be reacting to any internal stimuli.

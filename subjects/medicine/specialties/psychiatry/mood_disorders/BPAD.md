- Bipolar II disorder: hypomanic episodes + depressive episodes
- Bipolar III disorder: Depressed patients who develop hypomania during treatment for depression
- Bipolar IV: Depressed pateints with substance induced hyopomania
- Cyclothymia: dysphoric episodes alternatic with hypo-mania

------------------------------------------------------

### Treatment

# Treatment of phases of BPAD
- acute mania
    + lithium, antipsychotic, anticonvulsant for elevated mood
- acute depression
    + antidepressant in combination with mood stabiliser
    + use of antidepressant may cause transition to mania (esp TCAs and venlafaxine, SSRIs much lower likelihood)
- prophylaxis
    + mood stabiliser

# Ongoing Investigations
- lithium tests (monitorign treatment efficacy and toxicity)
    + baseline thyroid function, UEC, urinalsis, creatinine clearance, FBE
    + ECG
    + especially in older women, then repeat TSH, T3, T4 every 6 months
    + ongoing lithium levels due to narrow therapeutic index (maintain within 0.4-0.8, >1.5 causes toxicity in some people

-------------------------------------------------------


# Clinical
presentation
- manic symptoms
    + elevated mood
    + irritable mood
    + increased self esteem/ grandiosity
    + increased talkativeness
    + flight of ideas

- psychological (education, adjustemnt lifestyle, harm reduction)

# Manic episode
 - DSM-5 
    + Manic episode
        * elevated/irritable mood >1 week
        * 3+ of DIG FAST
        * impairment
        * not @organic
        * +delusional features / requiring hospitalisation
    +  Hypomanic episode
        * elevated/ irritable mood >4 days
        * 3+ of DIG FAST (but less severe)
            - eg grandiose == elevated self esteem
            - thought form more organized @hypomania
            - speech loud and rapid but not necessarily pressured
            - risk taking behaviour not as severe
        * impairment
        * not @organic
- clinical
    + time course
        * manic episode
            - usu sudden onset (over few days)
            - duration weeks-months
        * hypomanic episodes
            - are generally shorter, resolve within weeks
- Triggers
    + antidepressants (changing)
    + stress/ sleep wake cycle dysfx/ emotional stimuli
- Types of mania
    + 
    


# Bipolar I disorder
- basics
    + manic episode, preceded and potentially followed by hypomanic/ major depressive episodes. the manic episodes are the distinguishing factor from BP2D
- diagnosis
        * Major depressive episode
            - A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same two-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.
            NOTE: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition.
                1) Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (eg, feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observations made by others (eg, appears tearful). (NOTE: In children and adolescents can be irritable mood.)
                2) Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).
                3) Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (eg, a change of more than 5 percent of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (NOTE: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
                4) Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
                5) Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
                6) Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
                7) Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).
                8) Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by their subjective account or as observed by others).
                9) Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.
            B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
            C. The episode is not attributable to the direct physiological effects of a substance or to another medical condition.
            D. The occurence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.

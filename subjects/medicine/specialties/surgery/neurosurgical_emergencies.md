###### Nsurge emergencies
    spinal cord compression
    raised intracranial pressure
    subarachnoid haemorrhage

# Spinal cord compression
    often missed! with huge complications
- etiology
    + location
        * 80% extradural
        * 15% intradural
        * 5% intramedullary
    + causes (most common)
        * tumor
        * degenerative 
        * infection
- investigations
    + MRI
- clinical
    + pain
    + neurological defecit
    + red flags (TUNAFISH)
        * night pain
        * trauma history
        * cancer history
        * IVDU
        * steroid use
        * age (young or old)
        * fever
        * nerugolocial changes (eg including bladder/ bowel )

# Raised intracranial pressure
    normal 10-15, but wide range of physiological pressures based on activity
    v. important is the pressure differential (cause movement of contents)
    cerebral perfusion pressure (difference between ICP and MAP)
    Monroe Kellie Doctrine: volume inside skull can increase with compensation, but then exponential rise in ICP
- natural history
    + complications
        * coning (foramen magnum, cebellar tonsils look like a cone)
        * unconscious 
- clinical
    + headache: 
        * slower course, worsens over days to weeks to months
        * assoc with N/V
        * drowsiness
        * %%papilloedema @enough time
        * worse after sleeping @supine @venous blood engorge @valveless system in brain. 
        * relieved @vomiting == hyperventilation causing reduction in CO2
- treat
    + elevate head to increase venous return
    + mannitol (v. fast acting diuretic)
    + hyperventilation possible @intubation
    + treat seizures @wld cause further hypercapnia
    + @too much CSF:    
        * insert external drain/ ipsilateral
        * 


# Subarachnoid haemorrhage
- clinical
    + headache
        * severe sudden onset headache 'impact'. v. different character.
        * %previous sentinel headache ~weeks before. 'had this headache, but then seemed to get back'. similar characteristics. 
        * usu more posterior head/neck, then usu becomes generalised.
        * %triggered @orgasm/ exercise
    + natural history
        * bleeding site aneurysm is most dangerous @high risk of rebleeding.
        * complications
            - v important normotension
            - avoid pain/ coughing/ vomiting/ agitation
    + conscious state
        * range: minor confusion - coma/ death
    + meningism
    + focal neurological signs
        * esp CN3 (@posterior communicating artery aneurysm)
    + bleeding site
        * %AVM
- differentials
    + meningitis: time course more subacute
    + migraine/ cluster headache: headache character usu different
- investigations
    + CTA
    + LP (do as soon as possible with most experienced clinician @need clean tap)
        * only risk of LP in situation of obstructing hydrocephalus
        * RBCs (just looking for blood)
        * xanthochromia (only positive after 12 hrs)

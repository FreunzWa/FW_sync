###### Cognitive impairment

neuropsychologist - may make a diangosis of MCI/ dementia
- a referral to a neuropsychologist should be made @screen positive for MCI on history (eg with memory copmpolians)
- also must rule out other reversible causes. often a CT non contrast is used to rule out other underlying causes such as subdural hematoma, NPH, cerebrovascular disease. 


# Mild cognitive impairment
- theory
    + intermediate state bewteen normal cognition (or a normal cognition defecit consistent with the aging process) and dementia
    + prevalence ~15-20% in population >65 years and older (in this age group dementia ~10%)
    + refers to cognitive impa
    + proceeds to dementia at a rate of up to 10% (whilst people without MCI progressing to dementia abt 1-2% per year)
    + must rule out other reversible causes to determine @other underlying causing a presentation of MCI/ dementia.
- criteria
    + not demented, definite mild cognitive complaint reported by patient or relative with preserved functional status, not explicable by normal aging process or an underlying organic cause
- categories
    + amnestic MCI (aMCI): precursor to AD, most common subtype of MCI, about twice as common as non amnestic MCI. 
        * categories @impaired memory without meeting criteria for dementia.
            - eg. memory complaint, esp that is corroborated by informant. with general cognitive function preserved and intact ADLs
            - considered as memory defecits 1.5 sd below average.
        * %associated with mild other domains which are affected, eg mild problems with ADLs
    + non-amnestic MCI (naMCI)
        * relatively isolated impairment in a signle non memory domain, such as exec functioning, language/ visuospatial. 
        * may progress to other dementia syndromes eg FTD, PPA, DLB, other parkinson plus syndromes. 
        * less general risk of progression to dementia. 
- rx
    + pharma
        * no currently approved medications which reduce the rate of progression to dementia.
        * donepezil may have some very mild improvement in symptoms in the first year- 2 years of MCI. but do not reduce progression to AD. 
        * Vitamin E not effective. 
    + lifestyle
        * exercise, cognitive stimulation may also be mildly efficacious in improving symptoms, ?reduce slightly rate of progression to AD
        * memory training

# Delirium
- often confusion / encephalopathy are used synonymously with delirium. 
- 30% of older paitents suffer at some point during hosptialisation (esp @surgical patients)
- very underdiagnosed
- usu @nonspecific response fo the brain to usu combinations challegenes from systeimc illness/ medications/ disorientation. usu with normal brains require significant physiologtical challenge (eg @ICU and ++drugs), but in diseased brains (eg @AD) even a trivial challenge == delirium (eg UTIs)
    + usu trigger @medical condition

# Prognosis
- the symptoms may last a long time after the onset of delirium -- months and the congitive deecline may be incompletely reversible. 
- drastic increase in in-hospital mortality

# Basics
- types
    + psychomotor variants:
        * 25% hyperactive delirium
        * 25% hypoactive delirium
        * 35% mixed pattern (fluctuations, lucid)
        * 15% normal psychomotor activity

# Clinical
- presentation
    + acute onset (< days), fluctuating
    + %hallucinations (usu visual)
    + %delusions (usu persecutory)
    + disorientation, cognitive impairment
    + psychomotor agitation/ retardation

# Risk factors/ triggers for developing delirium
- pre-existing medical conditions
    + dementia, parkinsons disease, psychiatry illness, stroke, sensory impairment, advanced age, malnutritions
- predisposing
    + low SES, previous delirium, impaired cognition, low education background, depression, functional disability
- non-medical triggers
    + environmental factors (lack of ventilatin, lack of window, lack consistent care, lack orienting aids)
    + catheterisation, lots of lines
    + prolonged sleep deprivation
    + restraints
    + noisy environment
    + dehydration
- medical triggers
    + drug causes:
        * polypharmacy (either @certain drug reactions or interactions between drugs)
            - eps if 3+ drugs are added within a given admission
        * drugs: lithium, antipsychotics, opioids, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedatives, hypnotics, anticholinergics
        * withdrawal syndormes (eg @alcohol/ BZDs)
    + metabolic 
        * deranged Ca, Na, Mg, PO4
        * hormone deranged: T3/4, PTH, pancreas hormones, pituitary, adrenal hormonees
        * hyper capnea
        * hyper/ hypoglycaemia
        * hypoxaemia
        * vitamin B12 deficiency in WKE
    + brain disorders
        * CNS infections
        * epilepsy (esp non convulsive status epilepticus)
        * heaed injury
        * stroke, tumor
    + organ failure
        * resp, cardiac, liver failure, renal failure, hematological
    + infections
        * UTI 
        * sepsis
        * meningo/ encephalitis (eg herpes simplex encephalitis)
        * other infections

# Assessment of patient with features consistent with delirum
- history
    + short onset loss of congnitive function from baseline
    + MSE: dedcreased arousal, attention, oritentation, cognition, insight and judgement may be imapired, impaired speeh and thought contnet.
    + examination
        * dehydration (turgor and mucous membrane)
        * abdomen (urinary retention/ faecal impaction)
        * chest
        * neurological examinatiojn (appearance of new signs)
        * vitals (+lying and standing blood pressure readings)
- diagnosis
    + DSM-5
        * core features
            - disturbance in attention/ awareness
            - develops over short period, fluctuates and is reversible
            - additional disturbance in cognition (memory, disoritentation, language, visuospatial ability, perception)
            - not better explained @other diagnosis, not @coma
            - evidence on history/ examination/ investigations that is caused @medical condition
        * may be accompanied with
            - psychomotor behavioural disturbances (hypo/ hyperactivity)
            - emotional disturbance
            - hallucinations
            - tremor/ agitation
            - sedation
- differential diagnosis -- distinguishing
    + primary differentials
        * sundowning (delirium only in the evening hours)
        * focal neurolgocial syndromes (temporal/ parietal dysfunction), occipital (blindnes/ confabulation)/ frontal (executive dysfunction), nonconvulsive status epilepticus
    + collateral history very important (get baseline, rate of onset of cognitive changes)
        * get collateral @GP, nursing home staff, family
    + Dementia
        * key is time course -- delirium develops over hours/ days, and persists days to months. it is the ONSET that is acute, whereas dementia is subacute/ chronic. often more sevedre night, and may actually be a lot better during the morning ward rounds -- so the diagnosis may be missed @only single point assessment by the physicians
        * get premorbid functionality, this could be delirium on a background of dementia, which is a risk factor in and of itself. 
    + Dementia with lewy bodies
        * may be more challenging as DLB is a little bit more fluctuant so a bad period can mimic delirium, and is also associateed with psychotic features complex visual hallucinatioins which can also be mistaken for acute psychotic feature sin association with delirium
- clinical tools
    + CAM (confusion assessment method)
        * yes/ no questions for cognitive features present in teh patient, which is used to support or give didagnosis of delirium in a paitet.
        * for a diagnosis of delirium by CAM, pt must display:
            - acute onset and fluctuating discourse
            - AND inattention
            - AND EITHER
                + disorganised thinking
                + altered level of consciousness
    + CAM-ICU
    + DRS - delirium rating scale
    + Delirium symptom interview
    + cognitive assessment
        * NUCOG, RUDAS, MMSE

# Investigations
- should be used @consider pt with delirium, looking for possible medical cause
    + serum
        * UEC (electryolyees, renal function)
        * Glucose (hypoglycaemia or hypeer can cause delirium)
        * FBC/ CRP (infection)
        * TFT (hyperthyroidism can == delirium @already at risk pt)
        * toxic screen of blood and urine (BZD abuse is the most common cause @odler patients)
        * blood gas (hyperventilation, or in MAcid may suggest @DKA, Lactic acidosis, sepsis, toxins)
        * Vitamin B12 and other nutritional screening
        * Urinalysis/ UTI screen
        * LP
    + imaging
        * CT
            - may be indicated @history, or not obvious cause because couldbe caused @stroke
    + EEG
        * rule out non convulsive status epilepticus
        * confirm diangosis of certain metabolic encephalopathies iwth characteristic EEG waveforms.
    


# Management
- identify predisposing and precipitating factors promptly
- provide supportive care and prevent cx
- treat neurophysciatric manifestations
- frequent reviews, obs
- supportive care
- pharmacological treatment
    + indicated @safety to pt/ others is threatened or prevent provision of proper care to the patient
    + options:
        * first line: haloperidol (best evidence)
        * usually not to use: BZDs may worsen symptoms @exacerbation of disorientation/ however may be used @psychomotor agitation and harm to others/ self risk
- ongoing cognitive function assessments
    + to monitor progress and response to treatments


# Prevention
- is the most important
- environmental modifications
    + orienting aids
    + consistency of care staff
    + natural light
    + ventilation
    + noise pollution minimised 
- patient
    + ensure sleep
    + help with sensory impairment (like get their hearing aid activated)
    + dehydration (give fluids)
    + symptomatic control

# Prognosis
- increased LOHS, associated with increase mortality rates.
- increased cognitive and functional decline causing increased nursing home admissions
- increaesd risk of other geriatric syndromes (UI, cognitive decline, pressure sores, falls). 
- accelerates the onset of AD after the initial delirium period by x3

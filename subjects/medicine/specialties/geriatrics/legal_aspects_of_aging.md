###### Legal aspects of aging


# Capacity
- clinicians role to assess capacity (eg consent for medical procedure, regarding fitness to drive, witness legal document)
- refers to a level of cog ability required before the peson can lawfully do various things. when lack of capacity == then alternative decision making  arrangements are needed.
- competence is the same -- in the US it is more a legal term.
- law assumes that the person has gained capacity once they turn 18, and presumed to have capaqity unleses evidence otherwise. disproving capacity is on the onus of otheers. 
- difference between lacking capacity and having poor judgement (--importantly means that declining a treatemnt does not necessarily mean incapacity.)
- lloss of capcity may prevent:
    + voting
    + enter into biding contract/ transferring property
    + authorising medical treatment
    + unterkate numerous other activites reg @law
    + having sexual relations with another person
    + becoming MP or hold public officees.
- assessment of capacity
    + formal assessment requires a triggere
    + testamentary capacity
        * not assessed @MMSE
        * neuropsychological assessment not usu required, but can be done @ongoing concenrs about testaementary capacity

# Criteria for having decison making capacity
- 1. understands information releeevant to the decisions and the effect of the decision
- 2. is able to retain information in relation to teh decision
- 3. is able to make a choice based on teh risk and benefit profile 
- 4. is ablle to communicate the decision and their opinions

# Obtaining consent
- consent must be obtained prior to any medical intervention -- exception is in emergencies where @delay == detrimental to health. 
- can only do treatemnts without consent @reasonable attempts made to locate teh instructional ACD/ MTDM and then noting the decision in teh clincial record.


# Will/ POA Basics
- both documents deesigned dto ensure persons wishes followed @time when teh person no longer has ability to make decisiondue to incapacity or deaeht.
- POA: in effect @still alive -- lapse on death
- Will: come into effect @death
- General non enduring POAs: lapse when person loses capacity
- Enduring POAs: endure beyond loss of capacity.
- the patient must have testamentary capacity
- will must be witnessed @2 adults, bot must witness the signing by the will maker, dont need to know the contents of the docuemnts.
- if worry that there is coercion involved, then speak to hospitals legal councel. junior members are not usually allowed to witness.


# Will
- legal doc, determines what like to do with eestate @death, also names teh executor of teh estate. 
- anyone 18+ may write a will. must be ssigned @2 witnesses, signed @presenc eof one another
- State Trustees can manage finances and write will.

# POA
- is a legal document where the patient appoints person/ people to make decision on behalf, the principal/ patient can seleect what areas the attorney appointed can make decisions in (personal, finance, lelgal)
- whilst the principal retains capacity, can make own decisions, but the differenece is the attorneys can make decisions on their behalf.
- principlal if appoints multiplle can select if decision are to be made jointly, bymajority, severally (separate decision making) or jointly and severally
- POA documents may relate to:
    + legal, financial, property matters, lifestyle, healthcare, accommodation.
- enduring? 
    + enduring: continues to be valid even @loses capacity. can be used for financial and legal as well, however no longeer can make a new EPOA for medical treatment decisions (this is a role subsumed by MTDM). however medical EPOAs made prior to March 2018 are still to be recognised.
    + General non enduring: lapse @loss of capacity, limited to financial and legal

# changes as of March 2018 - as of the Medical Treatment planning and decision sact 2016 commenced
- the medical enduring power of attorney is no longer appointable -- instead appoint a medical treatment decision maker, however the decisions made by an EPOA are still recognised if ther EPOA was appointed prior to teh rule change.

# Advanced care directives
- the person making the ACD must do so when they have decision making capacity.
- new documents that allow patients to specify either or both of the following areas (2 types)
    + values directive: specifies the persons values of preferences for future medical treaemtetn. (eg life is sacred or do not prolong suffering)
    + instructional directives: legally binding instructions as to what future treatemnts the person consents to or refuses. these are stronger, the clinician must refer to these before they consider any intervention.

# VCAT
- VCAT appointment of guardian for an adult with disability
    + will only be considered @there is no less intrusive option. 
    + eg. daughter wants mother with dementia to move into nursing home, but mother does not want to. she can be sent home with increased supports, but the daughter has right to submit VCAT application for the case to be formally heard. -- when it gets too difficult remember that this is where legals will step in. 
    + neuropsychological assessment would be required @submit a VCAT claim
    + the VCAT may appoint a guardian for an adult who is unable to make their own reasoned decisions by virtue of disabiltiy. the VCAT must be satisfied that less interusive otions have been trialledd.
    + will only be considered if teh person does not have capacity to make their own decision

# Decison making
- supportive attorney
    + helps a person with capacity make decisions
- next of kin

# Public advocate
- a submission 42K form can be made to the public advocate who can authorise a medical treatment for a peitn who does not have an EPOA medical, MTDM or a guardian VCAT.
- if the EPOA refuses consent, then the practitioner can within 3 days of withholding consenst make a submission to the public advocate 42K form to get authorisation -- this means that the EPOA would have to apply to VCAT to geet the submission overturned.

# Refusal of treatment certificate
- applies onlly to a condition that exists now, and does nto apply if the condition changes. 
- does not covery palliative care roles.
- i think ACDs are just better than these now after March 2018

# Driving
- assessment
    + tests of cognition -- MMSE/ nucog are a decent place to start, but dont assess ability to drive
    + OT driving assessment required.
    + no requirements for at age driving tests in Victoria, but doctor should ask for review if there is concenr.

    + vision
    + hearing
    + reaction times
    + upper and lower limb strength/ movements

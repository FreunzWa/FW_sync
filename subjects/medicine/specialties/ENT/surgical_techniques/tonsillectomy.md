###### Tonsillectomy +/- Adenoidectomy (T&A)
- removal of palatine tonsils/ adenoid tonsils + rarely lingual tonsils
- despite being performed less and less @recognised that long term consequences may outweight the benefits in more cases, still 2nd most commonly performed paediatric outpatient procedure

# Decision to operate
- indications
    + two main indication in children
        * OSA (SBD)
            - 5% kids snore. 2% probably have actual OSA. snoring not normal. VERY important to ask for other features of sleeping and daytime features.
            - p/w stetor, turbulent air flow darth vader breathing sound @sleeping, sleep restlessly, hyperextended, irritability, behavioural change, concentration problems, hypopnea. 
            - diagnose @sleep study @exam and history dont concur. get saturations, number of apnoea/ hypopnea
            - ==growth disturbance/ developmental concerns/ daytime sleepiness
            - assoc with cardiovascular/ cognitivie morbidities
        * chronic recurrent tonsillitis, paranasal sinusitis, adenoids, nasopharynx, mastoid air cells
            - severely affected: 
                + 7+ episodes in one year
                + 5+ episodes in 2 years
                + 3+ episodes in 3 years
                + but also consider length of episodes and interrupting school
                + also @increasing antibiotic resistance.
                + or even @1 severe episode of chronic tonsillitis
                + often prefer watchful waiting approach @tonsillar morbidity generally decreases with age. treat episodes with Abx/ analgesia
                + however reducing episodes clear after surgery, but only ~1 episode and of mild severity
            - moderately affected
                + definitely suggest against
                + benefits  of surgery very modest and outweighted @potential risk.
                + still  may perform @antibiotic allergies/ perintonsillar absncess, GAS risk + ATSI
    + adults:
        * tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma (adult)
- alternate
    + must weight up disease severity/ frequency of recurrent throat infections, preferences of the family, childs tolerance of antibiotics and other conservative therapies, accessibility of health care, out of pocket costs, further school absence (eg if already difficult coping @school)

# Adenoidectomy
- presentation
    + nasal obstruction
    + otitis media
    + adenoid facies

# Procedure
- technique
    + GA
    + options
        * coblation (controlled ablation of surrounding tissues)
        * plasma coblation
        * tonsillectomy device (BiZact)
    + LA as well intraoperatively, injection OR topical (may be equally effective @younger children)
    + postop
        * paracetamol/ oxycodon @breakthrough
        * postoperative oral abx 7 days
    + @other patient considerations for technique
        * @bifid uvula
        * @submucous cleft palate (usually contraindicated)
- risks
    + acute
        * bleeding (rarely can be life threatening). risk @>5 yrs, chronic tonsillitis, aspirin use preoperatively, clotting disease. need preoperative Pt count, Hgb level, plasma clotting variables.
            - treatment
                + inspection of oral area: active bleeding/ clotting
                + IV access + volume resus. 
                + Hgb, hematocrit + GNH and crossmatching
                + OR: cauterisation
            - classifications
                + primary (<24 hrs of surgery) risk 0.2-2.2%
                + secondary (usually over 24 hrs post surgery @scars begin to form, usu 5-10 days post operation), risk 0.1-4.8%
        * infection
        * ongoing
            - adenoid regrowth (esp @younger children)
            - increased risk of upper respiratory infections/ possibly chronic diseases @immune dysfunction
- recovery 
    + most children stay in the hospital overnight
    + usu takes up to 3 weeks before healing complete. usu at leat 2 weeks out of school


# Contraindications to T&A
- 3 main contraindications
    + velopharyngeal 
        * disorder of structure that causes failure of sofft palate to close against posterior pharyngeal wall that causes speech issues (eg hypernasalality)
    + hematologic
        * @anaemia/ disorders of hemostasis
    + infectious
        * active local infection in the past 3 weeks


Criticisms


- Bad conlusion
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and conjunctivitis risk without plausible mechanism or parental smoking history.
- “Abnormal breathing” is neither a clinically useful term nor relatable to a disease.



Bad conclusions from citations:
- “Current research suggests that tonsils and adenoids play specialized roles in immune system development and function” (reference from 1934, not current).1(e2)
- “Improvements in sleep apnea of children may be less than hoped for”1(e2) (reference actually states adenotonsillectomy “still offers significant improvements in AHI, making it a valuable first-line treatment for pediatric OSAHS”).6(800)

###### CKD 
- progressive relatively irreversible decline in renal function.


# Stages of CKD, with symptoms
    staged @biochemistry Creatinine levels -- to determine the eGFR
- Stage 1 (GFR>90): Kidney damage w/ normal function 
    + usu asymptomatic
- Stage 2 (GFR 60-89): Mild loss of function 
    + %swelling, HTN, %UTIs
- Stage 3a (GFR 45-60): Mild-moderate loss of function
    + Low blood count, malnutrition, bone pain, numbness/ tingling, decreased mental acuity
- Stage 3b (GFR 30-45): Moderate loss of function
     + Low blood count, malnutrition, bone pain, numbness/ tingling, decreased mental acuity
- Stage 4 (GFR 15-30): Severe loss of function
    + Anaemia/ appetite decrease, BMD decrease
- Stage 5 (GFR<15): Renal failure
    + Uraemia, fatigue, dyspnoea, NV, abnormal thyroid function, severe edema


# Risk factors for developing CKD
- age (exacerbates effects of HTN, damage to vessels, cannot heal as well)
- hypertension (damage to vessels == arterioles become hyalinised and narrowed == glomerular and tubular ischaemia == -=GFR)
- diabetes
- family history of CKD


# Diagnosis
"kidney.org.au" has good algorithm - get from module
- Starts with Kidney health check for people with known risk factors. 
    + If results of GFR and ACR are normal, repeat 1-2 years (or annually @diabetes/ hypertension present)
- Criteria:
    + A GFR < 60 that is present for >=3 months +/- evidence of kidney damage
    + OR evidence of kidney damage with or without decrease GFR evidenced by following:
        * Albuminuria
        * Haematuria after exclusion of urological causes
        * Structural abnormalities
        * Pathological abnormalities
- Confirming diagnosis
    + Follow up UEC within 7 days for GFR
    + morning first void urine A:Cr
    + GFR and A:Cr will determine the degree of CKD


# Investigations
- creatinine/ GFR
- urea
- urinalysis
    + proteinuria/ albuminuria (assoc @renal damage)
    + hematuria
- FBE (low RCC @-=EPO production)

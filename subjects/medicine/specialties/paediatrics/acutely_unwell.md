###### Acutely unwell

# BRUE (brief resolved unexplained events)
    event in infant characterised @marked change in breathing, tone, colour/ consciousness, with rapid return to baseline state. 
    cannot be explained @medical cause
    diagnosis of exclusion, important to differentiate from underlying diangnosis requiring further investigation.
- features
    + <1 min duration (usu 20-30 sec)
    + complete return to baseline state
    + not @identifable medical cause
    + 1+ of the following:
        * central cyanosis/ pallor
        * absent/ decreased/ irregular breathing
        * hypertonia/ hypotonia
        * conscious level change
- natural history
    + low risk of recurrence
- differentials
    + sepsis
    + pneumonia
    + meingitis
    + gagging
    + breath holding spell
    + head injury
    + hypoglycaemia
    + seizure
    + idiopathic
- assess as high risk or low risk to determine whether high or low risk BRUE
    + low risk
        * age >2 months
        * GA >32 weeks
        * only single BRUE
        * duration BRUE <1 minute
        * CPR not required
        * hx of child abuse/ recent injury/ systemic sx like fever / 
- treatment
    + @low risk == no specific treatment required
        * educate caregiver about BRUEs, no correlation with SIDS
        * reassure low risk
        * offer resources for CPR training
        * arrange followup to further rule out underlying medical causes
        * %ECG/ 1-4 SSU/ testing for pertussis (only @suggestive symptoms)
    + @higher risk == investigate more
        * BGL, SaO2 for 4 hrs, SSU, ECG

# ALTE
    broader term including BRUE, includes events caused by an underlying disorder
- DDx
    + repiratory infections
    + laryngospasm/ GERD


------------------------------

# Approach to febrile neonate
- get senior doctor
- admit for antibiotics +/- IV fluids
- FBE, CRP, Blood cultures, SPA, LP, %CXR

# 29 days - 3 months
- @no unwell features and cant find focus == do a urine MCS
    + consider FBE, CRP, BCs
    + consider admission and observation
    + @remains well and investigations normal, discharge
    + arrange followup 12-24 hours
- @unwell 
    + FBE, glucose, LP, lactate, CRP, blood culture, urine MCS. LP unless contraindicated. %CXR
    + empirical antibiotics: ceftriaxone + flucloxacillin (gent @meningitis exluded)

# > 3 months
- same as <3 months, but @no unwell features consider no investigations.
- unless prev UTI, age <12m and fever >24, fever >48 hr then consider urine MCS

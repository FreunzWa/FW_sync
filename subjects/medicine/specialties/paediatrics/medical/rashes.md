# Standard list of rash causing illnesses -- the common viral exanthems
- 1st: measles -- Measles virus
- 2nd: scarlet fever (GAS tonsillopharyngitis)
- 3rd: german measles -- rubella "3 day measles"
- 4th: Duke's disease
- 5th: Parvovirus B19 - slapped cheek syndrome or "Erythema infectiosum"
- 6th: Roseola -- HHV



# Urticaria
    always check for features of anayphylaxis (lip/ tongue swelling, tingling around the mouth, hypotension/ tachyacardia, difficulty breathing)
    common - 25% have at some stage
    angioedema when the subcutaneous extension deeper. 
    acute < 6 weeks, chronic > 6 weeks
[hives; pruritic elevated skin lesions surrounded by ertyhematous base]
- medical
    + mx
        * first attack can be the sensitising episode, further episodes may be worse
- clinical
    + H
        * triggers, explore history hours-days before the rash
            - after meals/ exercise/ other symptoms during rash, cold, pressure
            - medications
            - certain foods
            - contact allergy to plants, bites/ strings
        * frequency, timing, duration/ patttern and reucrrence
        * distribution
        * most cases are idiopathic
    + E
        * assess for anayphylaxis
        * wheals:
            - well circumscribed, general OR localised. coalescent. pruritic, excoration. flat centre w/ raised erythematous edge %with central clearing
    + I
        * RAST testing - can detect specific IgE antibodies to certain substance. specific to whatever teh child had eaten (Egg RAST). not urgent to do - can be done OP or in ED
        * SPT - referral to allergists.
- rx
    + avoid triggers (dont take aspirin or NSAIDs @== worsening)
    + anti-histamines (non-sedating preferred) to lessen itching
    + epipen to be given @anaphylaxis OR history of severe asthma OR family lives far away. generally dont use @no history fo anaphylaxis @causes stress

# Molluscum
    highyl contagious skin infection, @burst == ++virus released from the lesion so be careful with fomites.
    most of the timedont need treamtent but some parents may command treatment
- clinical features
    + papules 2-3 mm with central indentation (umbilication) systemic distribution
    + usu non itchy or painful
- treatment
    + usu no treatment needed, resolves 3m-3y @immune response
    + can cause 2ndary eczema == treat with topical steroid
    + be careful using towels etc 
    + cryoterapy/ curettage for individual lesions
    + stiulate immune repsonse (however scarring is worse with these) by irritiating the immune response
        * benzoyl peroxide daily
        * aluminium acettate solution for large areas
        * imiquimod

###### Vasculitis
    most common: 
        1. HSP
        2. Kawsasakis disease
[morbilliform; a rash that looks like measles]

# Kawasaki's disease (KD)
    medium vessel vasculitis ++affecting <5 yrs, %%older children/ teenagers. 
    2nd most common vasculitis affecting children (HSP is most common)
    most common cause of acquired cardiac disease
    pw 5 features
- epiid
    + ++<5 years and over 6 months
- medical
    + complications
        * CAA (coronary artery aneurysms)
            - ++%@ outside the nonrmal age range of 6 m to 5 y
- clinical
    + diagnostic criteria
        * Fever for 5 days
        * AND 4 of the following 5:
            - conjunctivitis (non puulent, painless)
            - lymphadenopathy
            - polymorphous rash (occuring in the first few days), %morbilliform
            - cracking of lips, strawberry tongue, hyperaemia
            - hyepraemia and painful edema of hands and feet that progresses to desquamation in convalesnce. %perineal desquamation
        * Other featuresE:
            - aseptic meningitis
            - sterile pyuria
            - dysuria

    + 'Incomplete' KD
        * when feveer for 5 days and 2/5 featurese OR infants with 7 days of fevert
            - various criteria based on lab testing to treat
- Ddx
    + EBV, adenovirus
    + Systermic juvenile idiopathic arthritis
    + Sepsis
    + SJS
    + Drug reaction
- investigation
    + TTE at baseline and 6 weeks
    + consider urine, ECG, blood culture, FBE, CRP, ESR (unreliable after IVIg provision)
- treatment
    + is with early IV Ig, v important to avoid cardiac complications / involement. 2 gk single IV infusion
        * repeat dose @first not effectigve
    + %use corticosteroids for high risk paitents with signs of shock or young patient.
    + discharged on aspirin until get a normal TTE (risk of stroke @CAA)
    + tert care @not responding or exceeding comfort level
    + DC @well for 36 hours after treatment. 

# Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP) - IgA Vasculitis (IgAV)
    urinalysis is the only investigation required for classic presentation of HSP. 
    most cases are self resolving within 4 weeks, require only sympatomatic management. however cutaneous lesions may last many months. 
    most common vasculitis
- basics
    + IgA mediated vasculitis affecting skin,  mucous membrane, kidneys.
    + 90% @children (most common vasculitis @3-15 yrs age group)
    + usu self resolving < few weeks, @33%recur == ++progress to CKD in adults
    + ++onset @winter @++URTIs, which is the trigger
- medicla
    + mx
        * systemic vasculitis @deposition of immune complexes IgA == inflmmation. 
    + complications
        * %%pulmonary/ neurological involvement w/ intracranial hemorrhage == life threatening
        * intussussception/ bowel ischaemia
    + prognosis
        * usu self resolves within 4 weeks
        * follow up episodes are more mild and resolve faster
        * %renal complications (CKD), 90% within 2 months of onset.
- clinical
    + presentation
        * Tetrad (varies @order appearance)
            - 75% p/w Palpable generalised purpura w/o coagulopathy ++@lower limbs @gravity. should appear @all patients. usu symmetrical.
            - 84%arthalgia, migratory/transient/oligoarticular  esp upper limbs w/ %periarticular swelling + tenderness
            - 50% abdominal pain %w/ N/V
            - 50% sx @renal disease (fluid overload/ haematuria/ proteinuria etc)
        * E
            - blood pressure (HTN?)
            - skin (palpable purpura usu symmetrical, gravity dependent)
            - painful subcutaneous edema (%periobrbital, hands, feet, sacrum)
            - %arthalgia esp large joints of lower limbs
            - abdominal
            - respiratory distress (?alveolar haemorrgage)
            - neurological (mental status, ?focal neurolgical signs)
        * Other rarer sx
            - subcutaneous edema ++periorbital
            - scrotal pain 
    + rf
        * HLA associations, male, %may be triggers
- diagnose
    + usu urinalysis only needed @classic presentation. %rule out others eg FBE, UEC, albumin, blood + urine culture, abdominal imaging, ANA, dsDNA, ANCA, C3/4 
    + w/ skin biopsy of affected skin purpuric lesion. this is usually reserved for atypical rash or those with ++renal diseaese.
- investigate
    + biopsy of ++skin, %renal biopsy to determine cause of renal impiarment if this is the maikn feature and suspicious of significant renal impairment
    + bloods:
        * normal clotting studies (APTT, PT normal)
        * renal studies (urinalysis - %include presence of red/ white cells)
- differentials
    + rule out meningococcaemia (non blanching rash)
- rx
    + usu recover spontaneously unless severe diseaase (rare). usu cared for @ambulatory setting. oral hydration + symptomatic relief. elevate edematous areas.
    + mild pain @subcut edema:
        * elevate affected area
        * %paracetamol/ NSAIDs may be used
    + moderate-severe pain
        * steroid reduce duration of abdominal and joint pain. 
    + pain treatment (arthalgia and abdopminal pain), use NSAIDs/ paracetamol.
    + GCs reserved for fulminant disease @SEs
    + inpatient care @severe disease (eg w/ renal involvement, hypertension, changes in mental status, severe abdominal pain, severe joint involvement)
 - followup
     + GP followup to determine renal function with urinalysis. %biopsy, renal specialist referred @hyeprtension, abnormal renal function, nephrotic syndrome ,persistent proteinuria.

# Behcet's syndrome (Silk Road disease)
- basics
    + rare, more common @silk road (more severe here as well)
    + small vessel vasclitis w/ systemic manifestations of oral apthae/ genital apthae/ skin lesions/ vascular disaese (w/ aneurysms/ thrombosis)
- pathophysiology
    + can involve blood vessels of all sizes (more commonly small)
- clinical
    + patient
        * 20-40yrs, %in children (and more severe)
        * most cases are sporadic/ but %familial
        * more severe @male
        * HLA-B51 association
    + presentation
        * ~100%painful recurrent mucocutaneous ulcers (more severe than RAS)
        * 75% genital ulceration, painful similar appearance to oral aphthae, recurrent, but less frequent than oral
        * 75% cutaneous lesions (purpura, erythema nodosum, palpable purpura)
        * ~50% ocular disease, w/ ++ episodic uveitis (natural progress to blindness), %cataracts
        * 10% neurological involvement (parenchymal vs. non-parenchymal)
        * vascular disease (aneurysms, thrombosis, venous disease, budd chiari syndrome, dural sinus thrombosis)
        * 50% arthritis
    + rx
        * chronic immunosuppression
        * lidocaine mouth wash
        * ocular disease: require systemic immunosuppression

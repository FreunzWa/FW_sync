###### Gastroenteritis
    infectious gastroenteritis == diarrhoea +/- vomiting (non biliois) + cramping abdominal pain
    usu oral rehydration sufficient, and preferable to IV
    @shocked == urgent IV NS bolus 20 mk 


# Assessment
- H
    + clinical
        * diarrhoea
        * %vomiting
        * %cramping abdominal pain
    + red flags
        * severe abdominal pain/ abdominal signs
        * persistent diarrhoea (>10 days)
        * very unwell appearance
        * blood in stool
        * bilious vomiting
        * vomiting without diarrhoea
- E
- I
    + usu no Ix needed. 
    + @blood in faeces or ++abdominal pain == can do faecal samples @bacterial cause more likely. however usu not change management. esp consider @immunocompromised, sepsis, diarrhoea protracted
    + UEC consider @severe dehydration, renal disese or diuretic use. alterred conscious state. doughy skin (suggest hypernatremia), ileostomy history
- ddx

# MAnagement
- ondansetron wafer
    + not recommended @<6 m or <8 kg
    + only give once
- oral rehydration
    + stop feed fortifications
    + aim small amnts fluid often
    + continue breast feeding
    + suggest ORS (gastrolyte/ hydralyte)
- trial oral fluids
    + aim for 10-20 mls/ kg fluid over 1 hour of ORS (give frequent small amounts)
- NGT rehydration
    + consider @ongoing vomiting/ profuse diarrhoea
    + NGTR preferred even @vomiting
    + most will stop vomiting @NGTR
    + @vomiting continues, consider ondans and slow NG fluids
    + rapid: @moderate dehydration + gastro == rapid rehydration. avoid <6 onths. 25 ml/ kg/ hr for 4 hours
    + slow: 
        * preferred @infants <6 months, comorbidities present, children with significant abdominal pain
    + IV
        * @fail NGTR or severe rehydration OR already an IV in situ OR @short gut or previous gut surgery
        * treat shock with 20 mk NS bolus
        * rapid rehydration of 10 ml/kg/hr for 4 hours of plasmalyte
        * rehydration roughly 6 ml/ kg/ hrfor 24 hours. use NS or plasmalyte + dextrose. if serum KCl < 3 mmol/ L add KCl 20 mmol/ L or oral supplements
    + reassess clinically after 4-6 hours, then 8 hourly for ongoing fluid therapy.

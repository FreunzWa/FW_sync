###### QT prolongation
    start of Q wave to the end of the T wave. represents time for ventricular depolaristaion and repolarisation
    inversely proportional to HR, interval shortens @faster heart rates, and longer @slower heart rates.
    significant @abnormally prolonged is associated with ventricular arrhythmia- eg TDP.

# Normal ranges
- QTc prolonged @:
    + @>440 in men
    + @>460 in women
- v. dangerous @>500
- QTc abnormally short @:
    + @<350 ms
- rule of thumb:
    + normal QT less than half the preceding RR interval

# Measurment
- measure @lead 2
- look at severa consecutive beats, take the longest time.
- large U waves that are fused to the T should be included in the measuremnet (exclude U waves that are separate)
- the end of the T wave is defined by the maximum slope rule w/ the isolectic line intersection

# Corrected QT interval
- because the QT interval varies @heart rate need to standardise, so QTc estimates the QT interval at standard heart rate of 60 bpm. use the QTc.
    + Bazett formula: QTc = QT / squareroot(RR): good for heart rates between 60-100
    + @HR outside the range 60-100 use frederica or framingham formula
    + use MedCalc

###### Pericarditis

- physiology
    + percardial 2 layered sac contains 15-50ml of plasma ultrafiltrate normally


# acute pericarditis
- etiology  
    + V
    + I
        * viral infection, %bacterial (eg TB)
        * post myocardial infarction
    + N
        * paraneoplastic syndrome
    + D
    + I
        * idiopathic
        * drug induced (isoniazis, cyclosporin)
        * post-radiotherapy
    + C
    + A
        * SLE
        * rheumatic fever
    + T
        * post cardiac surgery
        * blunt trauma
    + E
        * uraemia
- natural history   
    + 80%+ cases follow benign course. 
    + complications 
        * restrictive pericarditis
        * cardiac tamponade
- investigations
    + @++benign course often presumptive viral cause unless systemic unwell.
    + bloods
        * serial cardiac troponins 
    + bedside
        * ECG
            - 4 stage
            - widespread concave ST elevation and PR depression
            - reciprocal ST depression and PR elevation in lead aVR
            - %tachycardia
    + imaging
        * TTE (rule out pericardial effusion)
- clinicalrdial
    + presentation
    + high risk features:
        * fever >38
        * subactue course
        * haemodynamic compromise
        * large pericardial effusion
        * immunosuppressed pateints
        * anticoagulated patients
        * acute trauma
        * failure of clinical improvement post 7 days of NSAID/ colchicine
        * elevated cardiac troponins
- treatment
    + @benign and uncomplicated == outpatient treatment
    + non pharma
        * restriction from strenuous activity
    + pharma
        * colchicine (3 months to preent recurrence)
        * NSAID
        * @NSAID CI: GCs used at lowest effective dose
    + intervention
        * drain pericardial effusion if present
    + surgical
        * pericardectomy
            - @chronic/ recurrent constrictive pericarditis @thickening of sac may offer removal of all or part of pericardium


# Dressler's syndrome
- aka postmyocardial infarction syndrome is secondary pericarditis +/- pericardal effusion @AMI


# Chronic constrictive pericarditis
- mechanism
    + @scarring/ hypertrophic changes to pericardium == loss of elasticity == restrictions to cardiac filling/ compression of heart and may cause of Rv volume decrease @IV septum migration
- etiology
    + very rare @viral 
    + more common @TB pericarrditis/ other bacterial causes of pericarditis/ paraneoplastic sydnromes
- presentation
    + fluid overloaded/ ++elevated JVP
    + kussmauls sign (lack of insipratory decline in JVP)
    + diminished cardiac output

###### Heart failure

# Presentation
- RHF
    + peripheral edema
    + GI symptoms
    + hepatic congestion
- LHF
    + dyspnoea @PO/ orthopnoea (worse @lying down)/ PND (sudden waking)
    + -=end organ perfusion (fatigue/ weakness/ confusion)
    + nocturia/ oliguria
    + angina (impaired diastolic filling through CAs), palpitations
- examination
    + pulse
        * pulse (weak, rapid, thready @HF)
        * pulsus altenate (alternate strong and weak pulses)
    + cool, cyanosis
    + BP (low pulse pressure <25% of the systolic value)
    + JVP (congestion @HF) == kussmaul's sign
    + apex beat (displacement laterally). very good sign. (midclavicular line 5th IC space). hyperdynamic vs. hypokinetic
    + ausculatation (valvulopathy)
        * S3 gallop rhythm (tennessee sound @reduced ejection == blood slushing around still)
        * S4 (kentucky sound)
    + lung 
        * coarse crepitations
        * pleural effusion (Stoney dull)
    + abdomen
        * hepatomegaly
        * hepatojugular reflux
    + peripheral edema
        * sacrum
        * scrotum
        * legs


# Investigations
- ECG
    + @normal ECG == 98% NPV
    + sinus tachy/ arrhthmia
- FBE
- lactate
    + end organ perfusion
- UEC
    + renal failure (can exacerbate) + baseline
- LFT
    + @RHF == hepatic congestion
- BNP
    + released @wall tension in response to overfilling @HF == correlates with cardiac failure
    + good prognosis for chronic HF
    + good test in both rEF and pEF
    + other causes of BNP elevation, and underestimates @obese
- CXR
    + stages of APO on CXR (SP but less SN)
        * 1: cephalisation (vessels larger @upper lobes)
        * 2: kerley B lines
        * 3: air bronchograms @alveolar edema. cotton wool appearance, pleural effusions. 
- TTE
    + evaluates pressure, pulmonary hypertension 

# Severity
- NHYA (prognostication)
    + 1
    + 2
    + 3
    + 4 (restless @breath)

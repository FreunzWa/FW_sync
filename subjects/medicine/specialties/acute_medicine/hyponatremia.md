###### Hyponatremia
- @Na+ < 135 mmol/L
- disorders of serum sodium are predominantly a FLUID issue rather than an issue of insufficient sodium stores.

# Approach
- pseudohyponatremia?
    + @measurement issues @:
        * ++glucose == flux of fluid into vessels == dilutional effect (correct for glucose)
        * @++hyperlipidaemia/ @++hyperproteinaemia == falsely low values
- symptomatic? (see clinical presentation below)
- chronic vs. acute?
    + different treatment (@more rapid correction of Na+)
    + chronic @>48 hrs of hyponatremia
    + refer to prev blood tests (eg contact GP)
    + otherwise assume chronic hyponatremia
- hypotonic vs. hypertonic:
- determine fluid status to influence managemnet decisions



# Clinical
- presentation
    + usu neurologicacl @increased ICP @cerebral edema
    + non-specific (usu asymptomatic until 125)
        * fatigue
        * nausea
        * dizziness
    + neurological (@more severe) @cerebral edema
        * convulsions
        * obtundation
- history
    + diet and fluid intake 
        * (tea and toast diet @low solutes in the diet) and also reduced water intake
- examination
    + fluid status (euvolaemia/ hypovolaemia/ hypervolaemia)

# Complications
- falls
- delirium
- cerebral edema/ stroke/ herniation

# Hypotonic hyponatremia
    most common cause of hyponatremia @serum tonicity determined @sodium conc and accompaying anions
- causes
    + primary polydipsia (water intoxication)
        * @++consumption of water == exceed kidney capacity to concentrate urine
    + medication causes
        * thiazides:
            - block distal NaCl reabsorption transporter == Na+ and water secretion
            - ==difficult to interpret osmolality or urine and serum
        * antidepressants
        * antiepileptics
        * antipsychotics
        * %PPI/ NSAIDs
    + 

# Hypertonic/ isotonic hyponatremia
- hyperglycaemia
    + very high hyperg == intravascular fluid expansion == hyponatremia but still elevated serum tonicity
- nonconductive glycine (sorbitol/ mannitol) irrigation solutions @prostate/ uterine surgery 
- IV immune globulin  @combined with mannitol/ sucrose


# Investigations
- standard
    + UEC
    + paired: serum osmolality/ urine osmolality
        * @low serum == redistribution (fluid) issue or malnutrition (-=Na+)
        * @low urine 
            - @SIADH
            - @compensatory reuptake of Na+ to maintain Na+ levels
- pseudo:
    + lipids
    + BSLs
- TFT 
- morning cortisol/ ACTH

# Managemnet
- Acute (<48 hrs) and symptomatic w/ seizing/ coma
    + raise by 1-5 mmol/L/hr until symptoms resolve or 125-130 mmol/ L
    + hypertonic saline 1-2 ml/kg/hr OR 50 ml bolus
    + IV frusemide
- Chronic (>48 hrs OR unknown duration) symptomatic
    + calc Na+ defecit (UEC)
    + correct Na+ by 4-8 mmol per day
    + IV frusemide
    + fluid restrict
    + repeat Na+ readings every 2 hrs
- SIADH (reset osmostat)
    + fluid restrict (500-1000 mL per day)
    + frusemide 20-40 mg/ day 
    + NaCl tablets 3-18 g/ day
    + urea
    + desmocycline
    + rx:
        * vasopressin receptor antagonists (but not used much yet)
- reverse cause
    + medications

- referral to endocrinology @severe:
    + @<120 mmol
    + central symptoms (coma/ convulsions)
    + target only increase to 120
- vasopressin receptor antagonists
    + newer medications, not used a lot yet 
- @primary polydipsia (dilutional)
    + fluid restrict == kidneys concentrate urine effectively
- Na+ correction
    + @chronic cannot increase Na+ by 4-8mmol per 24 hr period (this is pretty easy to overshoot so best to be conservative) -- avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome.

# Iatrogenic rapid correction Na+
- treatment
    + @rapid correction == give desmopressin (ADH) or dextrose (has Na+ osm of 0) but maintains osmolality

# SIADH
- @++ADH == retaining ++fluid and excretion of Na+ (high urinary osmolality)
- @respiratory causes/ malignancies (paraneoplastic)/ strokes/ infections/trauma/ surgery/ nausea

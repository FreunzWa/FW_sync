###### Hypercalcemia
- PTH dependent
- PTH independent

# Investigations
- ECG (slowing)
    + %AV block
    + %bradycardia 
- PTH dependent


# Causes:
- intake: 
    + Ca2+ intake, vitD, hypoMg2+, hypovolaemia, TPN
- redistribution
    + hyperparathyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, immobilisation, malignancy, granulomatous disease
- output
    + urinary reabsorption (@thiazides)


# Hyperparathyroidism
- primary
    + PTH secreting parathyroid tumor (benign adenoma)
    + 4-gland hyperplasia (associated with MEN syndrome)
- secondary
    + high PTH produced @low Ca2+ (often @early stages of CKD) -- Ca2+ is normal
- tertiary
    + initially secondary @CKD, but the prolonged hyperstimulation causes continuous autonomous overproduction of PTH (PT glands are insensitive to Ca2+). will require parathyroidectomy


# Presentation
- history
    + bone pain, muscle pain 
    + GI upset: constipation, abdominal pain
    + neurological: lethargy, confusoin, delirium, comatose, hypotonia
    + renal: polyuria, dehyration, calcium stones, dehydration
    + palpitations
- examination
    + dehydration, consciousness state

# Investigations
- ALP (bone turnover)
- Ca2+ levels
- PTH levels
- X-ray/ CT/ bone scan @?bony involvement

# Management

###### Cardiac arrest rhythms
    Shockable
        VT
        VF
        SVT
    Not shockable
        Asystole
        PEA
[non-perfusing rhythms; non measurrable blood pressure, nno pulse  - PEA and asystole. others are poorly perfusing]
[ROSC; return of spontaneous circulation]

# Pulseless electrical activity
    Has ECG findings which show heart rhythm that should produce pulse but does not. Usu @insufficient mechanical contaction of the heart to produce a palpable pulse or measurable blood pressure.
- medical
    + @causes that result in circulatory shock states:
        * impairment of cardiac filling
        * impaired pump function of heart
        * circulatory obstruction
        * pathological vasodilation

# Asystole
- rx
    + immediate and excellent CPR
    + rapid reversal of underlying causes, esp readily reversible causes (eg ptx, cardiac tamponade)
    + adrenaline 1 mg IV every 3-5 minutes

# CPR in cardiac arrest
- not effective in obstructive shock (eg tamponade/ ptx), and as these may be rapidly reversible must assess for initially.

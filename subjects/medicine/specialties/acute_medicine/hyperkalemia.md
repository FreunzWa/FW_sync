###### Hyperkalemia

# Approach
- increased intake
- decreased excretion
    + renal failure (-=eGFR == -=K+ excretion)
    + renal tubular acidosis (different types cause hypo/ hyper)
- K+ redistribution (potassium and protein "two P's in the pod of the cell")
    + hyperosmolar state
        * water drawn out of cells == gradient for K+ == hyperK
        * hyperglycaemia
        * hypoinsulinaemia (insulin helps K+ flux into cells )
    + metabolic acidosis
        * @++H+ == pulled intracellularly. K+ reduced @balance electrical gradient
    + tissue breakdown
        * direct release of K+
    + drugs
        * suxamethonium (depolarises cell membrane == K +pulled out)
        * digoxin (Na+/K+ ATPase paralysed)
- medications   
    + K+ supplementation (chlorvescent/ slow K)
    + TPN
    + RBC transfusion

# Presentation
- history
    + often aysmptomaitc
    + palpitations
    + constipation
    + weakness
- examinations
    + often none
    + decreased bowel sounds

# Investigations
- ECG (% poor correlation)
    + @>5.5:
        * tall tented T waves
        * shortened QT interval
    + @>6:
        * longer PR (heart block)
    + End stage:
        * VT/ VF/ asystole

# Causes
- medications
    + ACEi
    + beta-blocker
    + potassium supplementation
    + spironolactone (K+ sparing diabetics)
- diabetics (assoc with renal failure / heart failure @microvascular cx)
- renal failure
- heart failure

# Treatment
- calcium gluconate (IV 10% in 10mL) + repeat @ 1 hr
    + esp @ECG changes/ cardiac RF
    + cardiac protection
- reduced K+ in serum
    + insulin (10 U short acting)
    + 50% Dextrose 50 mL solution
    + IV sodium bicarbonate @MA (reduce acidaemia)
    + resonium (++excretion @bowel). tastes crap
    + Frusemide (++kidney excretion)
    + %salbutamol but not often done.
    + dialysis

# Nervous system lyme disease
- basics
    + @complicated form of Lyme disease caused @systemic dissemination of borrelia burgdorferi. 3rd most common involved system is NS, in 10-15%.
- clinical
    + presentation 
        * early peripheral nervous system neurological disease, classical triad typically week-months after bite 
            - cranial neuropathy (++facial nerve palsy)
                + abrupt onset, ++CN7 (8% of all lyme disease cases), %extraocular muscles affected.  
            - Lyme radiculoneuritis (motor/ sensory or mixed)
                + 3% of all lyme disease. pain, may mimic mechanical radiculopathy. dermatomal distribution
            - bannwarth syndrome (refers to painful radiculitis with motor weakness, %CN palsy)
        * later central nervous system involvement
            - meningitis (most common form of involvement), %affects the spinal nerve roots. classic sx of meningitis. 
            - %benign intracranial hypertension
            - %encephalopathy (cognitive , fatigue, dymnesia)
            - lyme encephalomyelitis
        * %chronic neuro-lyme disease
            - unremitting MSK pain, fatigue, cognitive problems. (post-Lyme disease syndrome)
- investigate
    + CSF
        * pleocytosis, elevated CSF protein, intrathecal burgdorferi Abs. very SP for CNS lyme disease.

###### Neuroanatomy

# Mamillary bodies
- part of limbic system, @ends of anteerior arches of the fornix.
- part of the Papez circuit
- damaged @thiamine deficiency == WK syndrome == anterograde amnesia. 
- also atrophied @AD, schizophrenia, heart failure

# Ventricular system
- lateral ventricles
    + interventricular foramen (foramen of Monro)
        * drains lateral ventricles into 3rd ventricle
- 3rd ventricle
    + cerebral aqueduct (of Sylvius)
        * drains 3rd ventricle into 4th ventricle
- 4th ventricle
    + lateral apertures (of Luschka)
        * 2x one on either side, link 4th ventricle ot the cerebellopontine/ pontine cistern (SA space)
    + median aperture (of Magendie)
        * drains CSF from the 4th ve

# Subarachnoid cisternae
- spaces formed @openings in the SA space as subarachnoid only covers superficial surface unlike the pia. 
    + Cisterna magna (cerebellomedullaris cistern)
        * in angle btwn dorsal medulla and ventral cerebellum
    + cerebellopontine cistern/ pontine cistern
        * ventral aspect of the pons, drains the 4th ventricle through the foramen of lushcka (the lateral apertures)
        * contains basilar artery, AICA, origin of the superior cerebellar arteries, CN6
    + interpeduncular cistern
        * between cerebral peduncles of the midbraina nd the dorsum sellae and continous below with the pontine cistern. 
        * contains optic chiasm, basilar artery bifurcation, PCA, Superior cerebellar arteries, PCOMs, CN3
    + lumbar cistern
        * extends from conus medullaris ==> level of S2 vertebra. contains cauda equina and filum terminale. (site of LP)

# Tectum / Quadrigeminal plate
- Aka tectal plate, portion of dorsal midbrain upon which the superior and inferior colliculi sit.
- derived @alar plate of the neural tube
- related pathology
    + @masses in this region == parinaud syndrome or obstructive hydrocephalus




### Spinal cord anatomy

# DCML
- posterior column, contains tactile, vibration, proprioceptive information 
- white matter fasciculi decussate at the medulla, so in the spinal cord up until the level of the medulla contains ipsilateral information
- nerve pathway
    + 1st order neuron innervates sensory detector == enters spinal cord through dorsal sensory rami == synapses with 2nd order neuron in dorsal horn whose axon travels up the posterior column == decussates at the medulla @arcute fibres, the gracile fibres becoming ventral, cuneate dorsal == synapses @thalami VPLN with 3rd order neurons == projections through the posterior arm of the internal capsule to cortical processing areas. (++parietal cortex based primary somatosensory cortex)
    + trigeminal nerve fibres also join teh fasiculus, these fibres synpase at the VPMN nucleus of the thalamus instead
- fasciculi
    + cuneate fasciculus (cervical/ thoracic levels), above T6
        * lateral to gracile, forms at higher levels
    + gracile fasciculus (sacral/ lumbar levels), below T6
        * medical to cuneate


# Corticospinal tract
- white matter tract, ++originating @primary motor cortex (B4), supplementary motor areas, cingulate gyrus. 
- nerve pathway
    + cortical areas == posterior limb opf internal capsule == through cerebral crus at the base of the midbrain == form pyramid shapes @anterior medulla. 90% fibres decussate @medulla (to form the lateral corticospinal tract), whilst 10% fibres do not decussate and stay anterior. upper motor nerurons leave fasciculi @level, synapse with LMN nucleus in the ventral horns w/ interneuron (inhibitory). 
- divisions
    + lateral corticospinal tract
        * controls movement of the limbs
    + anterior corticospinal tract (10% of fibres, close to midline, anterior)
        * controls trunk muscles, for postural control etc.

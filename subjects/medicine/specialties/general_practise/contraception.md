###### Contraception
- in general, without contraception 85% of couples pregnant after 12 months. (average sexual activity for age of couple)
- concept of ideal contraception
    + is 100% effective
    + minimal side effects
    + non invasive
    + set and forget, maintenance free
    + effective against STIs as well
    + minimal interference with intercourse
- hormonal methods
    + progestin/ progesterone
        * progesterone is the hormone which suppresses GnRH/ FSH/ LH release and thus prevents formation of the ovarian follicle (at high conc). at low conc it causes change in cervical mucous/ changes tubal motility == inhibition of fertilisation. also suppress the endometrium 
        * estrogen is not needed, but is often present in formulations to act as an endometrium stabiliser (less breakthrough bleeding). adding it however may increase the risk of VTE and Breast Cancer in ceratin populations. 
    + estrogen + progesterone

-----------------------

# Active compounds
- progestins: are compoudns derivede from progesterone, they interact with PRs (A/B/C), acting at tissue sites (uterus, cervix, vagina, breasts, brain). they interact with the hypothalamic PRs == -=release of GnRH, and pituitary == -=FSH and LH == thickening of cervical mucus and inhibition of ovulation == effective contraception

------------------------
### Methods

# Intrauterine contraception
- Cu-IUD
    + precautions
        * UKMEC4 for insertion @PID, or UKMEC2 @continuation 2 with PID
        * pelvic TB == UKMEC3/4

# Oral medication
- combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP)
    + precautions
        * smoking, obesity, uncontrolled hypertension, UKMEC4 breastfeeding in first 6 weeks (UKMEC2 <6 months), 0-3 weeks postpartum period (UKMEC3 even @no VTE risk factors), 3-6 weeks postpartum (UKMEC2 @no risk factors for VTE, otherwise UKMEC3), history of stroke or ischaemic heart disease == UKMEC4, VTE history, or family history of VTE in first degree relative <45, AF == UKMEC4, UKMEC3 @BRCA, or past breast cancer, known thrombogenic mutations (eg Factor V leiden), migraines are often an issue - esp if they have aura (==UKMEC4)

# Sterilisation
- female/ male sterilisation is 99%+ effective but poorly reversible, eesp @wait few years after sterilisation

# Subcutaneous hormone systems
- Etonorgestrel (Implanon) 
    + single rod in inner upper arm slow release only progestin.
    + PRO
        * 99.95% effective (most effective method available)
        * 3 years
        * easily reversible
    + CON
        * 





# 99% effective contraception
- male and female sterilisation
    + very effective but relatively permanent.
- hormone implant (etonogestrel)
    + works by 
    + 99.95% effective. is the most effective method. 
    + lasts for 3 years
    + easily reversible
    + single rod, progestin-only based contaceptive in SC in the inner upper arm for long acting (3 yrs) contraception. very slowly releases the progestin over 3 yrs (but possibly longer)
    + adolescents are excellent candidates @these groups ++stop other methods. 
    + back up contraception is recommended for the first 5 days (this is conservative since changes should be at most within 36 hours). so use condoms.
    + said that rule of 2. 2 love it, 1 thinks its okay, 1 doesnt like it, 1 hates it. should be counselled that the dysmenorrhoea may nly last for the first few cycles.  
    + CI
        *  (known/ suspected pregnancy, history of VTE - however this may be lower @progestin only, hepatic dysfunction, undiagnosed genital bleeding, breast cancer history)
        * because PG is at lower concentrations, ovulation may actually begin again but @low conc of PG == -=fertilisation risk == still effective. 
    + SEs
        * local site reaction in 9%
        * breakthrough irregular uterine bleeding. this is highest in the first 3 months of use. decreases during the 1st year. 
        * migration/ nerve damage
- copper intrauterine device (TCu)
    + about 99% effective, lasts 10 years, but has been shown possibly to last longer (especially for women who are less fertile @older)
    + SEs
        * allergy is very rare, 
        * greater risk fo pelvic inflammatory disease/ upper genital tract infections. 
        * not tolerated as well as other progestin IUDs
        * ectopic pregnancy less common than @merina 
    + uses
        * can be used for emergency contraception if used within 5 days of intercourse. 
    + impact on bleeding pattern
        * %heavier menses, longer, particular in teh first several cycle. more cramping, more bleeding req. (more than LNg). spotting more common
    + actually possibly reduce endomterial cancer
- intrauterine device (merina) (LNg)
    + levonorgestrel IUD, releases progestin which is in low enough concentrations to remain only active at the level of the endometrium.
    + SEs
        * ectopic pregnancy @using merina more common than @copper IUDs
        * get increased spotting, prolonged bleeding, unscheduled bleeding. should be councelled that these side effects are nt dangerous. 
        * amenorrhoea is als ocommon, in about 1 in 5.
    + uses
        * also reduced menorrhagia/ anaemia/ enomterioiss related pain, PID, cervical cancer. (these are off label indications)



# 75% effective contaception


    + 99% effective
        * implanon (99.95% effective, lasts up to 3 years)
            - most effective method. relatively inexpensive esp w healthcard support. easily reversible. 
            - SEs: dysmenorrhoea. 
            - 5 finger rule (3 will like it). 2-say this is a nuisance in my life. add a pill @gets through this period initially @will reduce bleeding symptoms. 
        * copper intrauterine device
            - causes local inflammation == pain and bleeding. 
            - most effective non-hormonal method. 
                + thus used in patients with a VTE/ breast cancer risk
                + also stops a pregnancy up to 5 days after fertilisation. (for some people this is controversial @may represent an abortion). 
                + should time with menstrual cycle
            - 
        * intrauterine device
            - SEs: invasive. moderate-severe pain during and after the procedure. spotting after. inserted at GP clinic. risk of migration/ falling out. increased risk of ectopic pregnancy @falls pregnancy. no periods, or progressively lighter periods. 
    + 90% effective
        * OCP (91% effective, usually due to forgetting, or metabolic differences)
    + 75% effective
- barriers to contraception
    + lack of comprehensive sexual education, may cause lack of correct use in contraceptie devices. 
- risks vs effectiveness of a given contraceptive method
    + use the UK-MEC tool to determine risks assoicated with intrauterine contraception.
    + risk of VTE or other SEs with use of combined oral contraceptive. 


# Oral contraceptive pill
- take hormone for 21 days and then 7 days off. 7 days to allow the ovaries to return. 
- missed pill rules (2 or more pills missed)
    + if miss pill in the week leading up to break, then dont take the 7 days off period
- however it would preferably be repackaged to take the pills constantly. this means no period. likely it is safe.

- safety categorisation (UKMEC categorisation) - there are many components to these but the main ones are given here
    + UKMEC1
        * non smoker
    + UKMEC2
        * Smoking: aged <35, or age >35 and stopped smoking >1 year ago. 
    + UKMEC3
        * Smoking: >35 and smoking <15 cigarettes/ day
    + UKMEC4
        * Smoking: >35 years and smoking >15 cigarettes/ day


# Implanon
- evaluation
    + pros
        * lasts for 3 years, quick reversal
    + cons
        * can only be inserted/ removed by doctor/ nurse
        * no protection from STIs
        * SEs: reduced libido, 25% amenorrhea/ dysmenorrhoea/ sore breasts/ headache/ bloating
- insertion procedure:
    + non dominant upper arm subdermal inner aspect about 8-10cm above medial epicondyle
    + insertion site marked with surgical pen
    + area cleaned with antiseptic

    + puncture skin with needle angle less than 30 degress
    + applicator lowered to horizontal
    + slide needle to full length
    + unlock the slider, move it back until it stops
    + feel teh implanon in teh arm
    + local dressing
    + pressure bandage to minimise brusing

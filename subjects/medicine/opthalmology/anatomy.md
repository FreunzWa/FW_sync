###### Ocular anatomy
    Lamina cribrosa - connective tissue extension of the sclera through whicht he optic nerve axons / vein/ artery pass
    corneal limbus - border of the cornea and the sclera
    Fascia bulbi (capsule of Tenon/ bulbar sheath) - thin membranes envolps the eyeball from optic nerve to limbus, separates from orbital fat and forming socket in whicheye moves. the EOMs insert into tenons, continuous with it
    adnexa - accessory visual structures (eyebrows, eyelids, lacrimal apparatus)
    check ligaments - tendon expansions of tenons capsule that surround the EOMs, which are quite tough limiting the action of the EOMs
    Lockwoods ligament - suspensory ligament of tenons capsule, fuses with fascia of inferior rectus and IO muscles.
    lamina fusca - inner pigmented layer of sclera

# Orbit
- the orbit is the cavity in the skull in which the eye + appendages sit.
- schematically, 4 wall pyramid, converge posteriorly @angle of 45 degrees. medial walls parallel, lateral walls make 90 degrees @extended posteriorly. 

# Arterial supply
- opthalmic artery
    + CRA
    + short posterior ciliary arteries (6-12)

# Venous supply
- sup and inf opthalmic veins drain into cavernous sinus, pterygoid venous plexus, facial vein. the superior opthalmic vein arises from the supraorbital and supratrochlear veins, branches of the angular vein == can allow infections of periorbital skin to cause CS thrombosis.
- central retinal vein
    + retinal veins and venules coalesce to form the CRV
    + accompanies the central retinal arteyr in the optic nerve
    + joins with the sup/ inf opthalmic veins
- vorticose veins
    + drain the ocular choroid (external to retina)
    + varies from 4-8, usu one in each quadrant
    + drain into superior and inferior opthalmic vein
- anterior ciliary vein

# Extraocular muscles
    4 rectus
    inferior and superior oblique
- rectus muscles
    + all originate @annulus of zinn
    + muscles are 40 mm long, becoming tendinous 4-8 mm from insertion @sclera. 
    + about 10 mm wide @insertion point
    + distance from corneal limbus:
        * MR: 5.5
        * IR: 6.75
        * LR: 7mm
        * SR: 7.5mm
    + vertical rectus muscles make angle of 23 degrees with the optic axis
- oblique muscles
    + control torsional movement %up and down movement
    + SO is the longest and thinnest, 30mm fusiform belly, then passes anterioly as a tendon for 10mm then over the trochlea pully continous downards and backwards. covered @synvoial sheath as passes in front of hte cartilaginous trohclea
    + IO originates @nasal side of the orbital wall just behind the inferior orbital rim and lateral to teh nasolacrimal duct. passes beneath IR, under LR. inserts @posterotemporal segment of the globe. muscle 35mm long. 
- vascular supply
    + supplied @muscular branches of ophthalmic artery
    + LR also supplied @lacrimal artery branches
    + IO also supplied @infraorbital artery branches

# Sclera/ Episcelra
- sclera made of collagen surrounds eye, continuous with cornea anteriorly and dural sheaht of optic nerve posteriorly.
- posterior scleral foramen is teh lamina cribrosa
- anterior sclera covered by episclera contains vessels to supply sclera
- sclera is 0.6mm thick, half as thick @insertions of hte EOMs

# Cornea
- transparent inserted into slcera @limbus, marked @scleral sulcus (depression in the sclera)
- regular collagen, less PGs than the sclera == transparent
- endothelium breaks down over life, cannot replenish itself much at all
- cornea 0.55 mm thick, ~11mm in diameter ellipse
- layers
    + corneal epithelium (gets most of its oxygen from atmosphere)
    + bowmans layer
    + the stroma
    + descemets membrane
    + endothelium

# Uveal tract
- structures (A-P)
    + iriss
    + ciliary body
    + choroid
- iris
    + shallow cone in front of lens, dividing anterior and posterior chambers.
    + blood supply @the major arterial circle of the iris, non leaky capillaries
- ciliary body
    + triangular in cross section
    + from anterior choroid to root of the iris
    + parts
        * pars plicata (corrugated anterior zone)
            - gives rise to the zonules
        * pars plana (corrugated posterior zone)
        *

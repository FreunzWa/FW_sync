###### Glaucoma
    disease of the optic nerve, centrally related symptoms. progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, affectingthe inner layers of the retina
    2nd leading cause of irreversible blindness, 67 million world wide affeced, >50% undiagnosed in Australia (significant VF loss before diagnosis) even @examined by eye care professional
    Difficult to diagnose @significant damage without symptoms before functional impairment.
    diagnosis at one point was just pressure, now also visual field analysis.
[inferior neural retinal limb]
[bupthalmic eyes]
[anti-scarring agent sponges mytomycin]

# Fundamentals
- mechanism
    + aqueous humor produced @ciliary body == anterior chamber, drained @trabecular meshwork
    + @?++IOP == blockage of neutrophic factors/ microischaemia == death of RGCs.
    + ?genetic factors
    + 

# Classification
- primary
    + open
        * most common type probably @microscopic changes in trabecular meshwork == blockage to drainage
    + closed
        * most common chronic and symptomatic
        * acute angle closure == nausea/ headache/ eye pain/ haloes around lights/ blurred vision. fixed, mid dilated pupil, clouding of cornea, %red eye
    + congenital
        * congenital big eyes/ cornea
        * %posterior embryotoxin
        * axenfeld-reiger's anomaly, Peter's anomaly (lens adherent to cornea)
- secondary
    + carotico-cavernous fistula
        * ++Episcleral vessels
    + pseudoexfoliation syndrome
        * more common @scandinavian, turkish, greeks. deposition on lens surface, and bulls-eye deposition on the pupil. %assoc with cardiac lesions. the material deposits in trabecular meshwork == ++high pressure, %increase quickly.
    + pigment dispersion syndromes
        * young myopic males, iris sits back == rubbing on te lens == pigment granules deposit in trabec meshwork.
    + uveitic
    + trauma 
    + neovascular

# Medical
- HEI
    + history
    + examination
        * optic disc (fundoscopy/ slit lamp)
            - need to correct for the size of the disc (absolute measurements are not accurate)
            - disc hemorrhages
            - localised RNFL (wedge shaped dark area - use red free) extending from the opti cdisc
        * gonioscopy (anterior chamber angle closure/ open == informs treatment)
            - direct vs. indirect
            - trabecular meshwork (visible in open angle)
        * intraocular pressure
    + investigation
        * stereophotography 
            - optic disc imaging (uses different angles == generates a 3D image)
            - OCT (ocular coherence tomography) to analyse optic nerve
            - visual field machine, provides progression prediction - this requires long follow up
- clinical
    + risk factors
        * ethnicity (black, african american)
    + complications
        * ++risk of falls and car accidents.
        * ++rate of depression
    + features
        * early asymptomatic: peripheral visual field defect (stays relative to point of focus)
- diagnosis
    + elevated IOP
    + visual field defect
    + glaucomatous disc
    + retinal nerve fibre layer loss
- screening
    + recommend optom visits >50, or >40 @have a family history


# Treatment
    IOP reduction
        medical treatments assoc with poor compliance == not effective and can be difficult for old patients to use. 
        surgical most effective
    no evidence for improved blood flow/ neuroprotection
- medical therapies 
    + topical
        * increase aqueous outflow
            - pathways
                + trabecular
                + uveoscleral pathway
            - prostaglandin analogues
        * decreae inflow
            - beta blockers
            - carbonic anhydrase inhbitors
    + lazer treatment
        * open angle:
            - trabeculoplasty
            - cycloablation (unpredictable/ unreliable results)
        * close angle:
            - iridotomy
            - iridoplasty
    + glaucoma surgery
        * trabeculectomy (gold standard, been around for 50 years)
            - create passage from anterior chamber to outside of the eye under conjunctiva. 
        * glaucoma drainage device  
            - plate sits exterior to eye, fibrous capsule forms over plate 4-6 weeks. 
        * minimally invasive glaucoma surgery   
            - aimed at preserving tissue, for mid-moderate glaucoma. usu performed @conjunction with cataract surgery
    + novel treatments in the pipeline
        * neuroprotection
        * stem cells
        * regrowth
        * transplanation 
        * bionic eye
- acute angle closure
    + diamox PO or IV
    + mannitol IV or glycerol
    + pilocarpine (but @ischaemic eye nt that effective)
    + steroids
    + peripheral lazer iridotomy most improtant (changes configuration of the iris to allow the angle to open up)
    + lens extraction last line
- peripheral iridotomy
    + for synechial angle closure
- indentation
    + if this opens it up is an appositional

# Fundoscopy findings
[normal cup to disc ratio < 0.6]
- features:
    + ++cup to disc ratio
    + hemorrhage in the disc region, followed by a notch in that region

###### Immune system syndromes

# Hyper IgD syndrome (HIDS)
- basics
    + rare AR autoinflammatory episodic disease w/ recurrent febrile episodes assoc with lymphadenopathy, abdo pain, ++IgD. 
    + presents first year of life, esp Northen european
- types
    + classic
    + variant
- medical
    + prog
        * non-life limiting, unless get %%%amyloidosis
        * however attacks have QoL impact
    + mx
        * thought that the elevated IgD is secondary to another inflammatory process (epiphenomenon)
    + cx
        * rarely associated with amyloidosis
- clinical
    + presentation
        * episodic (each lasting several days), usu 4-8 weeks between episodes. asymptomatic between attacks. %assoc with trigger.
            - unremitting rapid onset fever not @infection for days
                + prodromal sx: nasal congestion
            - 50%splenomegaly, esp in children
            - lymphadenopathy (90% during febrile episode)
            - 85%abdominal pain
            - rash
            - 80%arthritis/ arthalgia
- treat
    + aim to alleviate symptoms, improve QoL
        * sx treatment: I.NSAIDs PRN, II.GC III. (@require too much GC), anakinra or other biologics for anti IL-1 therapy
        * prevention: biologicals have been trialled for intervening periods
    + aim to avoid unncessary surgery/ Abx by making expedient diagnosis
- investigate
    + bloods
        * high IgD titre, but normal levels do not exclude disease (lower NPV)
        * high IgA (70% of cases)
        * acute phase reactants elevation (ferritin, SAA, CRP, ESR, leuks)
    + urine 
        * mevalonic acid minimally elevated (distinguish from mevalonic aciduria)
        * elevation of urinary leukotriene E4
    + genetic testing
        * MVK (mevalonate kinase gene) associations
- ddx
    + familial mediterranean fever
    + TRAPS
    + Periodic fevers with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis sydnrome
    + Muckle-well syndrome
    + MEVA (mevalonic aciduria)
    + acute intermittient prophyria
    + angioedema
    + other diseases may cause elevated IgD (eg HL, sarcoid, TB, Aspergillosis, HIV, Ataxia-telangiectasia)
    + familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS, urticaria)

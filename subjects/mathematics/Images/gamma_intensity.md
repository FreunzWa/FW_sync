- Gamma correction is nonlinear operation encodes luminance values in images.
- V(out) = A*V(in)^y
    + y = gamma. gamma compression is when y<1, so that 
- gamma used to encode images, take advantage of human perception that is non-linear in that something twice as luminant is not perceived as being twice as bright, only slightly brighter. if image not gamma encoded then spends too much bandwidth on freq humans cannot perceive, so it brings those brightness levels down to emulate how bright something would be perceived by a human.
- the lower gamma is the brighter the output image is.
- most images use a gamma for encoding of 1/2.2

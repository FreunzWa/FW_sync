###### Differentiation rules
- 

# Basics
- derivative
    + the derivative of a function of a varialbe is teh sensitivity to which the function output value changes to its input value (the rate of change at a point)
- understanding differentiation using limit (geometric explanation)
    + given curve, try to find the slope at a point. can use tangent line. however dont know slope of tangent. approach tangent line by using secant line, which starts of as two points separated on teh same curve, can easily calculate the slope. then take limit as x1-->x0 (or delta x approaches 0)
- applications
    + eg physics problems rate of change of other parametesr (eg rate of change of displacement is the velocity, rate of change of velocity is the acceleration, rate of change of acceleration is the jerk, jounce and so on)
    + sensitivity of measurements


# Notation
- leibniz notation 
    + dy/dx
- newtons notation
    + f'(x)

# undefined differential
- slopes must be continuous for a differential to be calculated

# Differentiation rules
- y = x^n
    + f'x = n(x^(n-1))
- chain rule
- product rule
    + used to find the derivatives of products of two or more functions
    + (f*g)' = f'xg + fxg'
